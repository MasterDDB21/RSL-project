This movie was my most anticipated movie of January and boy was I happy when I left. James McAvoy delivers one of the best performances ever (probably his best) as he portrays Kevin's 24 identities. Anya Taylor-Joy was also really good in this film as well as the other two girls and Betty Buckley. M Night Shyamalan delivers once again a unique, fun, interesting thriller. Split had some very good scenes (although sadly, some of them were shown in the trailer), as well as some memorable ones. Split also has a ton of humor, which works incredibly well. However, there were some flaws with movie, one of which was the thriller aspect. The movie had a ton of incredibly well acted scenes, but the film lacked suspense in some ways, which slightly disappointed me. Also, I thought the trailer gave a bit too much, so some good scenes were already spoiled. That being said, Split still delivered a great plot and a satisfying ending. I thought the film length was just about right, which is very rare. Split was a major improvement over The Visit and James McAvoy delivered an Oscar-worthy performance.

Wes Anderson, the creative mind behind the classics such as"",""\""""""""The Royal Tenenbaums\"""""""", \""""""""Rushmore\"""""""", \""""""""The Life Aquatic: With Steve Zissou\"""""""" and last years amazing \""""""""Moonrise Kingdom. Anderson also directed the great kid flick \""""""""The Fantastic Mr. Fox\"""""""". All of Wes Anderson films feature a zany, wacky, and fun energetic appeal, that not only make them insanely hilarious"",""but, unforgettable. His latest, \""""""""The Grand Budapest Hotel\"""""""" is quite possibly his greatest achievement. The writing is simply put, terrific. There is of course the grand ole Anderson appeal, however, this film is more sharp and on target every step of the way. The success can also be attributed in part to the incredible cast of characters. Ralph Fiennes undoubtedly steals the show portraying Monsieur Gustave H, a loyal concierge of the \""""""""Grand Budapest\"""""""". But I also have a feeling that audiences will be shocked by the real and authentic performance, that is turned in by newcomer Tony Revolori. This day and age in cinema were not usually graced with the pleasure of originality, in fact it's rather come and gone. Thanks to Anderson, and his creative ingenuity, chances are you're not just going to be laughing hysterically (and trust me, when I say, YOU will) but feel a sympathetic story of love, jealousy, rage, and betrayal. \""""""""The Grand Budapest Hotel\"""""""" basically has something, for everyone."""""""", """""""""""""""", """"""""The story (written by sir, Wes Anderson himself) takes place across the span of a few different time periods, split up into several parts. In the present the audience meets Zero Moustfa (F. Murray Abraham) the new owner of the Grand Budapest, who recalls his life as an infamous lobby boy, under the strict direction of notorious concierge, Monsieur Gustave H. Rewinding back to 1932, Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is a gigalo, known for his endeavours with older women. After his most personal client, Madame D (Tilda Swinton) mysterious dies at the age of 84. Thus, in her will, leaving a priceless painting known only as \""""""""Boy With Apple\"""""""" to sir Gustave H himself. Causing a spiral of events, framing the innocent man.

Taking into account Wes Anderson's, corky cinematography, at the same time it has the look, and feel of an old fashion murder mystery caper. However, Anderson still leaves his watermark, in his inclusive character development, and vigorous storytelling capability. In other words, the film is not as spectacular without it's extremely talented band of actors. Ralph Fiennes, idealistically steals almost every scene, of every line. The comedic timing, and his rapid fire of lines, is nothing short of perfection. He is extremely funny when he needs to be, but also, emotional when the story line demands it. Newcomer, Tony Revolori, get's his first shot at Hollywood, starring in his first film. I must say, after this performance, he has a bright career ahead of him. The list itself, goes on and on.

The deepest intentions of the film's plot may skew over the head of most mainstream moviegoers. Anderson's whimsical natures is still in tact, for most of the duration.

An assembly line, making the perfect movie. Everything is exactly in place, as it should be. Not to mention, extremely funny. In a new age, where sequels, reboots and adaptations are being jammed down audience's throats. There is a silver lining, and his name is Wes Anderson. Most people seem to be afraid to venture to their local cineplexes, as they should, paying upwards of $11 a ticket. The Grand Budapest, is one of possibly three movies a year, that is cinematic in all its aspects, and just amazing. Something that is extremely thought-provoking, serious, and has a message.

The detail and careful consideration put into each political moment of this historic amendment is quite astonishing, an ensemble cast full the shoes of various figures in the life of Lincoln as he attempts to be the driving force in the abolishment of slavery in the United States, but the opportunity to break away the financial roots of the Confederacy also played a major factor in an attempt to end civil war. The film doesn't have the typical blockbuster and big-budget effect that director Steven Spielberg creates, but instead we have gatherings of important people in dark, candlelit rooms as they argue for themselves but also what truly matters, peace, there isn't epic portions of flying flags, but instead there are intensely flawed characters, never really sure of loyalty or allegiance, equality plays a major factor in the film, not just amongst the people, but for the President himself, who is often held accountable for his past as a man not coming from a privileged life, but it also fits well with a film that wants to show the real side, as Lincoln himself uses tactics, as any politician does, to sway voters, using negotiators (James Spader, John Hawkes and Blake Nelson) to change the minds of a few Democrats. The performances are the true heart and brilliance of the film, Daniel Day-Lewis captures the mannerisms of what we perceive to be the man in the top hat, a soft spoken individual but one who seems tired and endlessly in thought, often brought back down by his passionate and forthright wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field), and his stubborn son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)."""""""", """"""""Writer Tony Kushner has managed to make the politics enthralling by working pivotal moments into passing parables, no fireworks or streamers necessary, it feels more real and candid when it is played out in this way, which Spielberg perfectly portrays onscreen."""""""", """"""""The film really should have ended five minutes earlier than it did, although we all know how the end of the sorry goes, many people probably still want to see, but a much better close happened a little earlier.

Lisbeth Solander is the girl in question, and what a fascinating specimen this girl is, underneath the gothic clothing, erratic eating and one night stands, Solander has a brilliant mind, but a fragile state is the even ground, we know that she has been raising herself from a young age, she does what she wants and really because she can, dresses as she does probably due to a lack of opinion from others and has taught herself to remain alone and isolated from society, yet when she is faced with a problem she will try her hardest to figure out a way around it, including her appointed guardian (Yorick van Wageningen) abusing her to the point of desperation, she isn’t a girl to be taken lightly, but she finds an unlikely friend in the man she was hired to investigate earlier, Mikael Blomkvist (Craig), who has his own problems. His story picks up surrounding a court battle which he has little chance of coming out on top, he decides to help out an old and tiring millionaire called Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) who lives on a private island, cut off from the mainland, he hopes journalist Blomkvist will help him try and solve the disappearance and probable death of his niece Harriet 40 years earlier, but when Blomkvist starts to dig, he realises the mess the family is in, relatives not speaking to each other, Nazi beliefs, estranged children and how clues seem to lead back to one or the other, a family matter indeed. The paths of the two leads cross as Blomkvist seeks the help of the young Solander, and their unorthodox relationship ensues."""""""", """"""""The film has much more than what it is at first glance, its a fascinating script with excellent performances being brought to life through the likes of Stellan Skarsgärd and Steven Berkoff, they all have secrets and unknown tales in their secluded island, but they all want to know why now? Why look for clues to the young girl now? Director David Fincher has a talent for making the little details count, the smoking habits, the sexual nature of the characters and the seclusion of it all, he captures the mood of a typically murky and gritty time with a beaten cottage beside a lake with snow falling heavily to the ground, the two leads come from very different lives, yet wind up on the hunt for a potential murderer on a secluded island. Mara holds her own with edgy brilliance and the damaged genius of Solander, Craig is a confident individual passes this to Mikael Blomkvist, a man who had it all but let his status get the better of him, Solander could be the very thing to bring him back down. This is a fascinating thriller that rightfully relies on its characters to spark the mystery of the story, its smart, intriguing and offers a different view in terms of heroic actions from unlikely individuals."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

Luckily, The Social Network got David Fincher (Curious Case of Benjamin Button) as a director, which makes it even better.

Since he had been playing a loser-with-no-girlfriend kind of guy, this is really typical for him. His fast talking and annoying ass attitude really stole every scene that the camera sets on him. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also gave fine, dramatic performances which MIGHT earn them an Oscar nod. But in terms of Jesse Eisenberg, he is guaranteed an Oscar nomination (he might even win considering there is no other good movies this time of year). Directing, writing, and acting all great in one movie is rare (to say the least). The Social Network succeeds in every assets that the film was trying to achieve."""""""" ]"""""",1,5,1,4"

I was four when the first Toy Story came out, and eight when the second one did. I pretty much grew up on Disney movies, Toy Story and Lion King being the two I watched most. Probably a few hundred times between the two of them (no exaggeration). I literally grew up with Woody, Buzz and the gang. Coincidentally, I started my first year of college last year, so Andy and I share a connection that is very personal to me. The people over at Pixar have done what has only happened a few times in history. Let's hope they take home the Oscar for Best Picture like the Lord of the Rings did, although I wouldn't get my hopes up. Those Academy douche bags... But back to Pixar. They created a damn near perfect trilogy. I loved this movie. This may be blasphemy to some of you, but I have to admit that Shrek 2 still holds the crown as my all time favorite animated film. After that is How To Train Your Dragon, then probably Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2 tied at third. Ratatouille is tied with Monster's Inc. for a very close fourth. As you can see, Pixar dominates my list, that does go on, by the way. Anyway, I think this was a perfect way to close the trilogy. The last fifteen minutes or so were very heartfelt and touching. I was on the verge of tears. When Woody said goodbye to Andy in the closing moments, I felt as if he was talking directly to me. The movie is altogether excellent. I have to admit that I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't impress me as much as everyone said it would. After reading over a dozen reviews with perfect scores, I had expectations that almost always lead to disappoint. I'm happy to say I was not. Not even close. The script is very well done. The music is just as great. The voice acting never felt insincere. And most importantly, I never got the feeling that some studio executive told the geniuses at Pixar to make this movie because it would clean out the pockets of millions of moviegoers I'm talking to you DreamWorks. I almost hated Shrek after the third movie, then they did a fourth?! No, I never got that feeling from this movie at all. It was a rejuvenation to a property that was already loved by almost everyone. The graphical detail in the picture was incredible. I have been fighting the Blu Ray takeover for months, but if there was ever a movie that would make me take my first step, it's this one. Nope, not even Avatar could make me do it, and I loved Avatar. I didn't see the movie in 3D because I heard some bad things about how dull it was. So I won't comment on that, but even without it, this movie is gorgeous. I loved it, and I cannot wait to buy it. I'm actually glad I never bought the first two. That means I can get whatever special trilogy box set they release hopefully this holiday season. It saddens me to know that their adventures are over, but I'm glad it ended the way it did. Waiting eleven years to do the final entry was probably not intentional, but it worked out for the best. At least for me because of my age corresponding to Andy's. I'm really going to miss those toys (at least until I get that box set). May Toy Story live forever."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

The best thing about this movie, for me, was the flashback sequences to Vito's early years, how he ended up living in America, how he got started in the mafia, how he made his first (I presume it was his first) kill, how he set up his most important element: Family. The absence of Marlon Brando is evident here, but its made up for as we have Robert De Niro playing the young Don Corleone. There is a vast difference between Michael and his deceased father, Vito. Vito immensly loved his family and it was evident that family was the most important thing to him. To Michael, that is not true. Note how he smacks Kay across the face, how he refuses to let her see his children, how he orders the execution of his brother Fredo. The final scene, where we got a flashback to the family at the table for Vitos surprise party, is quite a well executed scene, and it was interesting to see the familys reaction to Michael joining the Marines and that it was Sonny who introduced the despicable wife beater Carlo to Connie.

Saying that, at the time of writing this, The Hobbit trilogy is obviously in full swing, but it's a prequel, so this technically is the end. Just when we thought there was a silver lining after the events of the Two Towers, the battle of Helms Deep was mesmerising yet tragic, but a victory was in toe, yet as we kick off Return of the King, we realise that was only the tip of the iceberg, as Gandalf (Ian McKellan), King Theodin (Bernard Hill), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rys-Davies) continue their quest to stop the powerful Sauron, who is changing the very landscape of Middle Earth. Aragorn again plays a pivotal part in the finale, attempting to take back a throne that is rightfully his, Mortensen excellently shows so much development of his character over the three films, always fighting the good fight while looking out for those who matter most, now in the midst of leading a rebellion against Mordor. But the real journey still soldiers on with Frodo (Elijah Wood) as he edges ever closer to Mordor, but the ring continues to overburden him, alienating his only friend, Sam (Sean Astin), who can't seem to do right, he continuously warns his friend of the threat of Gollum (Andy Serkis), who has a more expansive role here, we see his humble beginnings as one of the river folk, with his eventual descent into madness well documented.

Almost every scene in the film proves significant, they all feel like closing moments of a long-running show, each character we have come to know over the films have very important roles to play in how the war will pan out, even the accidental travellers of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who proved more than useful in the fall of Saruman (Christopher Lee). We also have most visually spectacular of the three, the massive battle scenes on the edges of Mordor are some of the finest elements of the film, one of the smaller charges against the enemy comes to mind as we are treated to a beautiful medley from Pippin as many soldiers ride to their likely death. In terms of the ending, it really should have decided on one, but the film, or entire saga for that matter, has been such an achievement in special effects, writing, direction and acting, the muddled endings can be forgiven, for the crowing battle of Minas Tirith is a wonderful piece of cinema, combining real set pieces with spectacular effects seamlessly, it just works so well. Many will argue the ridiculousness of such a tale as this story comes into full play, debating whether they pack the emotional punch or relevancy of other masterful pieces, but take a look at how much an audience loves to get lost in a supernatural or fantasy world, and why shouldn't they? There is so much to relate to with these characters and the journey they have taken and where it will go, something we can do as well. It speaks volumes when we choose to separate from big bad out there to seek solitude in a riveting adventure, one which Middle Earth will always hold, there will probably be nothing quite like it again."""""""" ]"""""",1,1,1,0"

It introduces new characters while still maintaining heavy focus on the ones we grew to admire from the first part, the stories intertwine yet happen worlds apart, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have gone it alone to the fires of Mount Doom in the hope of destroying the ring of power, but they are my no means alone, as the shady creature known as Gollum (Andy Serkis) is on their every move, but he may soon prove his worth as the two hobbits seem to be going round in circles. Frodo is beginning to show signs of the ring overpowering him by now, he's grouchy, angry and taking it out on Sam. But another battle continues to rage as the evil Saruman (Christopher Lee) continues to raise an unbeatable army in the name of Sauron and the ring, an army that seeks domination of the lands, Rohan being the centre of it, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rys-Davies) are in search of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) who have been taken by the dangerous breed of Uruk-hai believing them to be Frodo."""""""", """"""""But there is more to it all that just needs to be watched, we have a reborn Gandalf (Ian McKellan) who helps steer the masses in the right direction, as each city must stand up and rise against the armies. We make way for one of the most memorable battle sequences in cinema history, the battle of Helms Deep, thousands of soldiers and even more orcs line the land to fight, it's raining, it's wonderful to watch and it's action packed, to the fullest. Wonderful to watch couldn't be used enough in this review, because the Two Towers is exciting from start to finish, whether its the epic battles, talking trees, continuing character-driven stories or vast landscapes of beauty, it takes everything from the first and doubles it, Aragorn seems to take centre stage in the film, as the Hobbits take a back seat for a while, the two hobbits on the way to Mordor are really just walking for most of the film, but Wood and Astin excellently play beaten travellers as we begin to realise the sway such a small object can hold, but Aragorn is the heir to the white city of Gondor, he therefore must salvage all the remaining hope in men, and deal with the many obstacles that stand in his path, but not without a few secrets to be revealed first, although he longs after Arwen (Liv Tyler), another woman, Eowyn (Miranda Otto) takes an interest in his peculiar being. Like before, it's the phenomenal acting and intriguing characters these actors portray that really bring the film to life, it's  visually impressive as ever, yet these larger than life heroes are likeable, easy to root for and give a sense of happiness and despair rolled into one, we have love, loss, hatred and frightening elements of the supernatural to enjoy. McKellan's Gandalf speaks heavily in riddle, and the more I watch this trilogy the more I think he knew along what was going to happen, the reason for his participation was a bored pensioner with not long left until retirement.  The element that drives Lord of the Rings head and shoulders above others is its own time and its own original world, everything about it breathes magic and fantasy, the Two Towers capitalises on success but doesn't settle to be just as good, it aims higher and opens up to a host of new characters and story lines that set up a massive and historic final chapter."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

She has been accepted into a beauty pageant 800 miles away and the whole family reluctantly agree to take the trip to support the young girl."""""""", """"""""Paul Dano plays the other child, a 17 year old who broods and speaks very little during the film as he is having a vow of silence until he fulfils his dream of being a test pilot. Each member of the family have their own grievances which come into play as the film unfolds, and they realise just how much they need each other. The film holds many messages of family values but its underlying themes really hit home the most, it categorises everything in life into simple reactions from other people, preparation, dreams, routine and perseverance, but also despair. Its at these moments that realisation can hit, whether something may not be for you or if you simply don't fit in, its not down to anybody else to say otherwise, being yourself is the most important part and the point of it all."""""""", """"""""Much like the job of Richard, the film is subtle and light-hearted life lesson from the excellent writing of  Michael Arndt, who holds the equally brilliant Toy Story 3 credit to his name, he manages to use various situations that can be summed up through equal means, Olive is the little girl who lets nothing get her down, and Abigail Breslin simply fits the role like a shoe. Steve Carell plays a character who has seen it all and simply isn't happy with it, and needs his dysfunctional family around him. Greg Kinnear delivers a riveting performance of a man who doesn't seem to pay close attention to his family, but this the exact reason why he struggles through, to support his family and not be seen as a failure. There to bring a realisitc approach to their situations is Alan Arkin, who tells it as it is and nothing more."""""""", """"""""A masterful yet subtle film that weaves in and out of every detail of a simple problem and lays it all out on the table to try and work out, with fantastic performances from each cast member who offer various explanations from their characters perspective that make this a must see show for a bit of comic relief and to get a lesson in being yourself."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

Peter Jackson brings to life the vision that author J.R.R. Tolkien envisioned in his fantastic books, full of heart, colourful characters and magical elements that set it heads above the competition, truly an adventure like no other. While much of the film shows the advancements of computer-generated magnificence, it possesses a very human touch from its ensemble cast and riveting stories that each of them tell, the biggest of course being that of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a hobbit who lead a simple way of life in the Shire, a quiet and peaceful place for those quite content with the easier but finer things in life, but as our story goes, Frodos uncle, Bilbo, holds a secret that changes the tone for the foreseeable future, as an evil is coming and Frodo holds the power to stop it, various events lead to Frodo and his other Hobbit friends Sam, Pippin and Merry (Sam Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan) setting out to destroy the ring in the place it was forged, the fiery Mount Doom. But as mentioned, there is more than this story being told, we meet shadowy ranger Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) who is certainly more than meets the eye, while we also have a hawk-eyed elf called Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the outspoken but proud Boromir (Sean Bean)  and a hot-tempered dwarf called Gimli (John Rys-Davies). The ring itself is a tempting power, a power that can entice and corrupt at any given moment, Ian McKellan plays an ageing wizard called Gandalf the Grey, who knows exactly what this ring is capable of, but is willing to guide this Fellowship until the end. This first entry combines everything into a near flawless film, fantasy, story-driven, violent, epic emotional and touching where it matters most, we don't have a perfect fellowship of individuals here, we have foes, untrustworthy acquaintances, accidental travellers and some not really wanting to be there, but they are all driven my one goal, one that will see them travel across Middle Earth to complete. Peter Jackson perfectly captures a world unlike any other, occupying it with magical mischief and all sorts of good and evil, which the film perfectly represents, it mixes light and dark and often cuts deeply into the flaws of both, while also showing first hand the power of the two on a massive scale, there's nothing quite like it."""""""", """"""""The mesmerising cinematography outlines the scope of the film, from lush green landscapes to the snow-covered mountaintops and deep into the underground, each place vastly different than the last, full of beauty, terror, frightening beings with groundbreaking effects, costumes and real landscapes that bring it to life, but this isn't possible without the phenomenal cast in tow. Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen are standouts of the film, engrossed in their characters where we can truly feel safe with them as we trek through Middle Earth, but the then relatively unknown Elijah Wood does an excellent job as the likeable Frodo, keeping a level head but standing up when necessary. Smaller roles are also filled by big stars such as Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Liv Tyler, who are on hand at various pit stops for the group to offer advice and solitude, or two bow to a greater force."""""""", """"""""This is undoubtedly a benchmark in cinema, combining so many elements of grandeur and action that its hard to find fault, it moves at a fluid pace and the long run time is not noticeable or over-bearing, we have so much to see, feel and admire that it feels right to watch this trilogy consecutively, otherwise the moment can indeed be spoiled, it surpasses all expectations and is simply sublime filmmaking, and it only gets better."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

But George Clooney plays a different sort of fixer, his character, Michael Clayton, is realistic in his approach to every part of his job, he isn't a miracle worker, nor does he make every problem disappear because at the end of the day, he simply cleans up the mess, but the bigger the mess, the more complex the clean-up. Clayton himself has problems of his own that he cannot sweep under the rug, while he may look the part, Clooney portrays a character who isn't everything he appears, he owes serious amounts of money to loan sharks after we discover his gambling habit, struggles  with financing his life and desperately tries to repair his past mistakes but still creating new ones, all while taking on a big \""""""""mess\"""""""". The law firm he works for is facing a crisis after one of its partners, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has quite the mental breakdown in the midst of a massive court case which Arthur knows the company his firm is defending are guilty of their crimes, something Michael is desperately trying to amend. It's clear to see why we have the title named after our main character, it is focusing on the life a man leads who feels he has no purpose, a man who is taken for granted and then thrown to the side, something Clooney portrays through many forces and silent stares, while we also see how he tries to balance his life as a dad and a man with a job that he can't really explain to anyone, but he shares the screen with someone else who is confident in her job but masks her demons, lawyer for the big client, a client called UNorth being sued for illegal chemical dumping  Karen Crowdor (Tilda Swinton), equally as cunning and potentially dangerous as Clayton. It's films like this where we look to the talent involved to realise they are the driving force of the film, the tension and chemistry they create while also taking from a sharp and smartly written piece from director and writer Tony Gilroy, who cleverly takes a sombre approach to have this business thriller being much more than it seems, there isn't realty an inspiring touch to leave you flabbergasted, but more about style and the performances, it focuses solely on the consequences of actions as we have many guilt-ridden characters with too much power on their hands. As mentioned, the performances are the standout moments of this film, Clooney proves his stability and grit while Swinton also shoes her worth as the sort of Yin to Clooney's Yang. It's a smart and complex film that stays intriguing thanks to its strong cast and compelling story."""""""" ]"""""",1,1,1,0"

Also, with these two comes a cast brimming with talent and versatile performances, especially from Frances McDormand, who puts in an Oscar-winning performance as cheerful yet inquisitive police chief Marge Gunderson, who is on the trail of two cons who have been hired by an in over his head salesman trying to rid himself of debts by collecting ransom money for his wife, but a series of mishaps and deaths put a whole different spin on a straightforward tale of fraud."""""""", """"""""William H. Macy plays the clever salesman who gets it all wrong, and the film perfectly captures him as a sort of anti-hero, simply trying to rid himself of worries but in typical fashion, good guys finish last. McDormand plays a woman who never truly seems up to the challenge, but surprises us at every turn, all the while being heavily pregnant. She lights up the screen with a budding and peculiar accent which only fits this type of film, she is sure to enjoy her day, but also do her job properly. The film manages to create a sense of wicked behaviour, but treat it as another day at the office for these gentle snow folk. The Coens create scenes that simply shouldn't be funny,, but the combination of a strong 'nice' accent and the comic timing from the actors, which is pivotal in many of the brothers films, make these scenes truly memorable to watch, they have ordinary and daily grind conversations, all while investigating a murder inquiry. Its the perfect blend of drama and thrill, but with a light-hearted stroke for those who simply love the art going on in front of them."""""""", """"""""It's truly a triumph not only for its time, but as time goes on, it never ceases to be a clever, simple and unique film, perfectly showcasing the Coen brothers for what they are known for, taking a simple premise and creating the most unpredictable and most engaging films imaginable, doing this through character interaction and environmental cues, combined with excellent scripts and pure talent in acting, easily one of the best films of the nineties for sure."""""""" ]"""""",2,2,2,0"

"the-naked-gun-from-the-files-of-police-squad!,10,roddersj04,/user/roddersj04,""Mar 27, 2011"",""""""[ """"""""2005: Serenity is released, a continuation of a brilliant TV show which had little viewers and was cancelled after one season. But that wasn't the first instance of that happening. 1988: The Naked Gun is released, 6 years after the cancellation of the TV series Police Squad! There were a number of character changes, like Officer Norberg, a caucasian character, becoming OJ Simpsons character, Officer Nordberg, but are we really complaining? After returning from taking down a terrorist act made up of famous leaders, in one of the films best scenes, Lieutenant Frank Drebin begins working on a case where his best friend and partner, Officer Nordberg, is hospitalised and framed for dealing in heroin. Along his investigation, Frank comes across his love interest, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) and her employer, Ludwig (played by Khan himself, Ricardo Montalban), with the latter involved in a plot to assassinate the queen through post hypnotic suggestions. When you read the plot, it sounds utterly ridiculous, and in any other movie, the plot would fail along with the film, but this movie makes it work. The Naked Gun knows exactly what it is, a slapstick humourous take on cop films, and it takes that ludicrous plot and makes it work, and it doesn't hurt that they add some hilarious moments. One of the films best ever scenes includes an encounter at the hospital which follows up into a car chase. Another brilliant moment includes Frank investigating into Ludwigs office at night, which manages to include fire, a concrete **** (i'm not joking here) and a possible sexual harrasment case against the poor lieutenant. The Naked Gun is also something which is rare nowadays: A good spoof movie. The reason it doesnt fail like the spoof movies which have been released in the past decade or so is because it doesn't try to spoof films directly, therefore not having any original or funny jokes. It spoofs a genre, police films, and makes its own way rather than recycling plot points form movies in the same genre, and it manages to make original AND funny jokes. The Naked Gun stars the late, yet great Leslie Nielsen as Lieutenant Frank Drebin of the Police Squad. He says some hilarious things and does a lot of slapstick throughout, but plays it all off completely straight faced, and it utterly works. Frank Drebin does some stupid things, but thanks to Nielsens brilliant performance, you can see that he doesn't acknowledge these things as stupid, just merely believes its all right in the line of duty. Oh, and you have to give props for this snippet of dialogue: \""""""""When I see five men stabbing a poor man to death in plain view, surrounded by eyewitnesses', I shoot the bastards, thats my policiy\"""""""" \""""""""That was a Shakespeare in the park performance of Julius Caeser. You shot five actors, good ones!\"""""""" I have never done this before, but this film deserves it. Below are a list of Youtube links to some of The Naked Guns scenes, if you want to see what the fuss is all about, if you want to revisit one of the best comedies of the 80s or if you just want a damn good laugh.

At first glance, this may seem like a simple testostorone based film that takes place within an actual fight club. Look further, for this is so much more. It is a satire on modern life, using things like schizophrenia & terrorism to illustrate this. Edward Nortons nameless narrator character meets two people who change his life: Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) With Tyler, the narrator creates a fight club, in which people who are stressed out and pissed off come to unload steam by beating the crap out of each other. It does make sense, by unloading your stress onto another person, concentrating it into every blow, you feel better about your day. The fight club then turns into something else entirely, an anarchic group whom commit acts of vandalism with cheer and smiles on their faces. Tylers actions may be anarchic, but they make sense. He believes everything has become so complicated with us wanting things we do not need, so sets out to destroy these things, like Starbucks. Each of the actors play their role convincingly. Edward Nortons insomniac narrator is a brilliant creation, along with the bat **** insane Tyler Durden. I gotta talk about the twist, that Tyler is actually another personality of the narrator. Once you know about this twist, watch the film a second time. You will see it make sense, and see the twist being sown earlier on into the story little by little. It is gritty also. For an example, see Edward Norton beating into Jared Letos face. Its so bloody. And when you see Tyler throwing Edward down the stairs, you know its actually Edward Norton throwing himself down the stairs, and thats a little creepy. The humour as well, Tylers earlier jobs, cutting porn into kids films and pissing in soup, is hilarious. Also, fight club members trying to start fights. They even cut a porn shot into the end of the film How can you not love this film? The acting, the writing, the direction, the twist, the storyline, its all brilliant. Quite bloody, but psychologically awesome.  If you haven't seen it, you must!"""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

It picks up right where Batman Begins left off with the Joker's card in Gordan's (Oldman) evidence baggie. There's not much that I can say about this movie that has not been said over and over again. One thing I can say is, if you did not like this movie at all then your taste is a little poor. Perhaps I'm not one to judge because I did like G.I. Joe and Transformers 2. This film has so much more to like than the average comic book adaptation. Rather than focusing on setting up spectacular action set pieces like most movies of the genre, Nolan puts drama at the heart of this one. We've all seen the original Batman, so there's no need for the Joker to run around Gotham with a tommy gun. Without saying too much, I'll say that the Joker has a much bigger agenda in this film than he did the first time. From the start we are introduced to him in the midst of a well planned, and well choreographed bank heist. Definitely cinematography at its absolute best, thanks to Chris Nolan and Wally Pfister. We are meant to see just how intelligent the Joker really is, despite being the most qualified for a life sentence in Arkham Asylum. Never have I seen an actor capture the essence of a character from literature as perfectly as Heath Ledger did with his. There has been much debate as to which actor was the best Joker. In my opinion neither came close to Mark Hamill's voice work for the animated series. All jokes aside, the performances in this movie are beyond amazing. I honestly believe Heath Ledger would not have won Best Supporting Actor if he was still living due to Academy politics, but he more than deserved it, and I'm glad he won it. All of the other actors did phenomenal jobs as well. Especially Aaron Eckhart as Harvey 'Two Face' Dent. My only gripe was Katie Holmes not returning for her role, but over a billion dollars later, thats her problem. The plot of The Dark Knight addressed my only complaint about Batman Begins. There isn't anything I can think of in this movie that was unrealistic in the advanced world we live in today. The premise is believable, and the story draws you in and never lets you go. I also have to mention the composer, Hans Zimmer returning from Batman Begins. The musical score in the two movies was another thing that I thought was damn near flawless. No spoiler intended, but the way it ended left so much to the imagination. It appeared that the Joker would have had a guaranteed spot in the third movie, but now I think they should just leave that character alone. Chris Nolan has a large task on his hands for the third installment. Topping this sequal will be a challenge. Lets just hope what happened with the Spider-Man franchise doesn't happen to this one. The Dark Knight was beyond anything I could have imagined. It's a film that will be talked about for many years to come."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

The Mask tells the tale of Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), the typical nice guy who, unfortunately, always finishes last. He then finds a mythical mask and when he puts it on, he is transformed into a love-lorn, confident, zoot-suited, green faced maniac who performs extraordinary feats, all obviously influenced by cartoons. This film is filled with such a number of iconic scenes (\""""""""The Mask and Tina dancing in Club Congo Bongo\"""""""", \""""""""The Mask and the cops having a full out dancing session\"""""""") and is packed to the brim with briilliant references and gags. The truly best jokes occur when Jim Carrey is The Mask. The film isn't just full of comedy or of cartoon gags, theres also character progression, as the more Stanley is the Mask persona, the more confident he becomes when he's himself, especially when he stands up to his spoilt heir of a boss. The beginning of when Stanley first realises his power he declares he could do the dreamed thing and be a superhero, but rather does the human thing: he uses the powers to solve his problems. He gets revenge on the rip-off car repairmen by shoving huge car exhaust pipes up their asses, he uses his Mask persona to woo Cameron Diaz (come on men, who of us wouldn't?) and robs a bank (the last one was more of a heat of the moment thing) Stanleys dog, Milo, is definately the best dog I have seen on TV and film. He manages to follow his kidnapped owner to the police station, even helping him to escape, he manages to escape from a cop car when the Detective cannot and even wears the mask at one point to help his owner best the gangsters. By the end of the film, you'll want a dog just like Milo. Detective Kellerman is a great antagonist for Stanley, investigating into the Mask. He's the kind of antagonist who manages to be a serious character and, whilst being serious, manages to make the audience laugh (with the help of dimwitted partner Doyle) The effects really hold up well nowadays, not looking cheap or too computer generated. The Masked Milo looks a tad on the cheap side, but you'll get over it. The Mask is a fun film which takes it's influences from cartoons and is not afraid to show that off. Even if you're not a Jim Carrey fan, you must admit, there's no one more perfect for this role than Jim himself. Truly Sssssmokin'"""""""" ]"""""",3,3,3,0"

The film kicks off with snippets of news programs all those years ago as the Watergate scandal was revealed, but also how there was evidence of a cover-up by the President of the United States. The film is a close tailing of Frost as he decides to be the first person to interview the disgraced former President, he has no TV channels behind him or any concrete advertising, but all this acts as part of the mindset that this young presenter is in, he is in it really to rejuvenate his career and for it to mean something again, but his team of researchers, and of course, the nation, want him to press the President for a confession of his involvement in a cover-up, a point at the beginning of the interview process that Frost bites off a little more than he can chew, seemingly unprepared for the onslaught of anecdotes and stonewalling he received from Nixon. Michael Sheen takes on the role of Frost, a role he also played in the stage version of the show, while Nixon is played  by Frank Langella, who also appeared in the same stage production. These two actors deliver fine performances, Sheen takes the stance in his character that he has nothing to lose with these interviews, yet when he is getting nowhere with his attempts at picking apart Nixon, he soon sees how it could all come crashing down, Langella perfectly incorporates the mannerisms and speech of Nixon, whose booming voice was one of his memorable qualities, but Langella also shows a man with regret and loneliness in his eyes, at some points even seeming like he wanted to confess, but remember, this is dramatised, because we don’t really know the type of relationship these two had other than in front of the cameras, but a certain scene which didn’t happen was added in, perhaps for the dramatic effect, where a drunken Nixon contacts Frost in the dead of night and discusses many character defects in vague detail, and although this event never actually happened, its pivotal for how the final interview plays out, and how Frost manages to have Nixon accept his guilt. In many ways the film certainly attempts to capture the essence of what went on during those interview days, but it also tries to make its own mark for the performances alone, which are the benchmark of the film, once these two sit face to face, thats when the magic occurs."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

This shows how paranoia has set into these characters lives, how they cannot trust anyone, because it could spell for their end. Kudos to the actors of this piece. They all perform their roles perfectly, from Charlize Therons suicidal mother, not wanting to live in such a terrible world, to The Thief, whom instantly regrets robbing the main characters. Viggo Mortenson and Kodi Smith-Mcfee perfectly play their roles as father and son. You truly believe their roles, and their character relationship. The man's death, whilst his son is curled upto him, is a scene which, i'm not ashamed to say, brought a tear to my eyes. The ending of this film really shows the boys trusting ways paying off, as he now travels with a family, across the trechorous landscape. Conclusion: Quite a bleak film, with many grim moments, but wonderful character interaction makes it all worth while"""""""" ]"""""",0,1,0,1"

Then came Scott Pilgrim I'll spare any plot explinations, as you probably know of this already, and get straight to the reviewing. The video game references are lined throughtout the film, from the 8-bit Universal logo to the defeated villians turning into coins. This film proudly shows its roots, along with animated sequences that look like they've come straight out of the comic book. The evil exes are quite formidable foes, but Lucas Lee has to be the best one, purely because of Chris Evans' portrayal (can't wait to see his Captain America) its a shame Lee isn't on for longer, cause every sentance that escapes his mouth is a riot, but he wasn't on for much longer in the comic, so it fits perfectly. We gotta give a big hand to the supporting characters. Knives Chau's obsession over Scott doesn't border onto annoying, and she goes to great lengths to win back Scott, even (failingly) dying her hair Ramona blue. Kieran Culkins character has to be my favourite character of the entire film, from his texting of Scotts life to his sister, to his coming onto the sisters boyfriend, he cannot go through an entire scene without brightening it up or spouting a funny comment (especially at Sex Bob-Ombs rival band) Gideon Graves is quite the formidable villain, I won't spoil the evil things he does but they fit when this film is setting him up to be the final boss. The fight scenes are brilliantly done (especially with Swords involved), the character moments are sweet, the humour is pitch-perfect, the characters are fantastic, and the evil exes are quite menacing. Scott and Ramonas romance is so lovely. Here, it seems to be a mere fling of the moment, while in the books its more of a serious relationship, and yes, parts have been sacrificed but i think Edgar Wright chose wisely.

As the film progresses, its clear to see the linear it follows, much the same as a Western, it has the stranger who isn’t part of the town, he breaks social order by confronting the rulers of the town, while he also has the chance to become honest. Rango tries his best to pull the wool over the eyes of the citizens, but birds, snakes and other unsavoury creatures make this quite difficult. Each character has been excellently brought to life through their voice actor, and through their relevant roles on screen, Bill Nighy and Ray Winstone are the ideal villainous cretins who terrorise the town, so Ned Beatty’s mayor decides that Rango should wear the Sheriff’s badge. The witty and smartly-drawn humour of the film is brilliant, it’s sort of a grown-up animation that has a variety of deadpan humour. Director Gore Verbinski shows his skills when commanding the great action sequences, there is a delightful chase sequence in the many canyons of the wild west that sums up the brilliance of the whole film, fast-talking, fast-paced and full of characters who could easily belong in a real film, they have limitless amounts of energy while the film has limitless amounts of opportunities to parody classical films such as Apocalypse Now and the endless amount of Westerns, it even use the talents of Timothy Olyphant to nod in the direction of the “Man With No Name”. This is a surprising and uplifting comedy that is colourful, breathtaking to look at and definitely raises the bar for a first rate story along with some excellent involvement of Hollywood stars, they bring the added flavour to the characters involved as Rango tries to figure out the water problem. Beauty and first-rate entertainment at its finest."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

The film opens in a colourful fashion with bright things and wonderful visuals, a film this good-looking hasn't been around since Avatar and these visuals are truly masterful, there is nothing quite like the spectacle when Pi, played for most of the film by Suraj Sharma, is attempting to survive on sea, witnessing many creatures of the deep while also keeping an eye on his fellow survivor, but survive being the most important part, the sea can be harsh, but a tiger whose only wish is to eat you can be so much deadlier. Director Ang Lee tells a lifelong story as an older Pi (Irrfan Khan) depicts his adventures, he does this in such poetic and beautiful fashion, showing an uneasy but necessary partnership between man and animal but still showing that animals can truly be unforgiving. Much of the film is Pi's attempt to train the tiger, named Richard Parker, their co-existence proving vital as the film unfolds.  The film takes much of its spectacle from a study of faith, as we learn that Pi is intrigued by the various forms that a spiritual being may take, he often speaks to God, and also accepts that his life may soon be coming to an end. Miraculous occurrences and anomalies could suggest he may indeed be playing a part, some of the scenes where Pi shouts to the sky are quite breathtaking."""""""", """"""""The winning formula of the film not only comes from the spectacular fantasy of the visuals, but from a very touching, tragic and a moving piece of colourful mastery that combines two unlikely companions while also dealing with many lifelong issues that Pi faces in a short space of time, he must overcome these insecurities if he wants to survive. It's quite a dream and quite an adventure, with an ending that questions what exactly is true and what isn't, it's left up to the viewer, pave it out for yourself, a magnificent achievement and a landmark in storytelling and visuals.

The message that is hidden below is about something that the protagonist does and that sometimes we also do it, which is to take shelter in the technology because of the fear to face the reality. That explains the job that Theodore has, why he is passing throw a divorce and also why he is so lonely. In addition to him there is Samantha, the voice of the OS, the amazing thing about her is that she is discovering the world, learning of life experiences and evolving as a consequence. I still cannot believe how Scarlett Johansson manage to transmit these, you can feel the wonder in her voice, how she test human feelings and her reaction when those things overwhelm her.

The two's bond feels natural given both their backstories and the peaks and troughs of their relationships are understandable and necessary for their arks.

Despite this hovering cloud of depression, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is an emotional drama, with captivating performances from McConaughey and Leto, both of whom I think will have a share of accolades to go along with their stand-out acting. McConaughey plays spell-bindingly as the homophobic, drug-addled womanizer, nuanced by his disease, and transforms into a more subtle human being. Leto, although, is by far more superb, in terms of acting ability. He portrays a more convincing woman than most women do themselves, something (pardon my sexism) I thought was impossible to achieve.

We realise the effect that news of such a multitude can hold, Luke changes his whole way of life in the hope of spending more time with his son, he runs into a friendly mechanic called Robin, he sees the talent in Luke but also sees it for a much more law-breaking sense. Luke and Robin soon embark on various bank robberies, initially to make more money to support Lukes family, but he ends up enjoying the adrenaline rush that comes with the territory. Robin is played by Ben Mendelsohn, who has really taken a career leap after is limited but effective appearance in The Dark Knight Rises, through his actions, we see the dangerous man that Luke is, he adores his son but not many others, brought to meaning by a strong performance as Gosling who is continuing to climb the ranks as one of the most sought after leads in Hollywood. But we also have a bigger picture, as an unprepared Luke runs into the law in the form of young cop Avery, played by Bradley Cooper,who takes the reins as the film begins to shift focus onto his character in fluid and well documented fashion, the cleverest part of this transition is the scenes that bare resemblances to earlier scenes involving Gosling, director Derek Cianfrance has did this to show the similarities of two men at opposite ends of the law, dealing with corruption, love and struggles in a marital relationship. We he quite a scope of film which opens up various side plots and also has a few time jumps which addresses characters and their ongoing life. A very calculated and edgy story keeps this film interesting as it always keeps is guessing with little given away to what the outcome is going to be, it builds at a slow pace to give its more pivotal scenes that added sense of urgency, as Luke bikes along the road it's like we're on the bike with him, candid and thrilling. We also have a small but memorable appearance from Ray Liotta, capitalising on grief while also being corrupt. The film finds its strength in its ability to piece everything together like a puzzle as the film moves forward, Dane DeHaan continues his hot streak in films with an almost show-stealing performance as the grown up son of Luke, while also starting a dysfunctional friendship with AJ (Emory Cohen), the son of Avery. This is a fascinating piece that has various plots that all fit together, strong performances round off a dramatic and clever story that never gives too much away, a scene that DeHaan and Cooper share outlines everything we know from the film, Coopers character asks if his son is alright, to which DeHaan replies \""""""""This isn't about your f*****g son\"""""""" but we immediately realise the film has everything to do with these children, a subtle yet powerful approach to a simplistic telling."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

This is the first scripted film Cohen has created, it falls a fluid story compared to the equally as hilarious but cringeworthy 'Borat' and 'Bruno', yet when I went to see the film, the cinema was in complete uproar, all in a good way of course, it certainly pushes boundaries but addresses the dark and black comedy that people seem to relate to today, its short and snappy at 89 minutes long, but feels just the right about of funny. Cohen plays the role of Admiral General Aladeen of Wadiya, he acts like we assume a dictator would, big palace, plenty of worshipping followers and a flamboyant lifestyle of sex encounters with celebrities, this set up includes a small role for Megan Fox, which is hysterical as we are then shown his wall of conquests, males included. But his life is always in danger, not only because of his regime and his slimy right hand man Tahir (Ben Kingsley), but he plays judge. jury and executioner (or so he thinks) as he will uses his power to dispose of any man who deceives him, yet this even comes down to a nuclear warhead not being pointy enough. When his visit to America ends i na betrayal of trust, he is thrust into the streets of New York unknown, as his iconic beard has been removed, he finds a radical anti-Aladeen health store run by Zoey (Anna Faris), unaware of his real identity, she lets him into her life. Faris has really let herself be the subject of many puns and putdowns throughout the film, growing real armpit hair and even being called a \""""""""chubby Justin Bieber\"""""""". Its full of direct attacks at everything involving the American Dream, and a particular scene in a helicopter with two tourists perfectly capture the mindset of an often paranoid nation, but probably for good reason. Its full of crude yet delicious humour that just gets funnier as the film goes on, it seems to play out as a regular \""""""""error of their ways\"""""""" film, but then throws it all back in your face to keep us interested, Kingsley is an unlikely delight alongside Cohen, while Faris continues to have excellent comic timing for all the right moments.

The story was actually darker than the first, but also emotional. The first reason was the Genocide theme. The second reason was an emotional scene where Po remembers his childhood and his parents by using Inner Peace, the kung fu technique. As for the rest of the story, I like the development of Po and Master Tigress's friendship. Tai Lung from the first movie was far more sinister and very frightening. In here, it was very hard to be terrified of a **** but the animators did their best to create an even more menacing villain as Lord Shen himself voiced by the magnificent Gary Oldman."""""""", """"""""The only problem that I do have with this movie was the script.

With flashy images and colors, Danny Boyle's style is showing up more in his films. 127 Hours is about a guy cutting off his arm. That is the plot, basic and simple. Aron Ralston is a hardcore biker who loves to climb and one day, just as you predicts, he got trapped. Being stuck in between a rock for 5 days with limited food, little water, no heat, and no restroom can really change a person's point of view. Seeing how he survives the five days feels like I'm watching a camping film. But 127 Hours is more than that, it has this hidden feeling that you feel bad for this guy. With his charming personality, James Franco was able to portray Aron Ralston accurately. This guy was really funny throughout the film even though he had to cut off his own hand. But whenever the movie focuses on how Aron survives, it becomes a movie about survival. This film is strictly about the art of cutting one's hand. 127 Hours gathers all the style of Danny Boyle and put it all together.

Three years later, Machete is an illegal immigrant living in Texas, who is then given an opportunity to kill a senator (Robert De Niro) who wants to get rid of all the immigrants. The job then turns out to be a set-up, as the Senator is shot in the leg by his own man and Machete is framed. First things first, this film doesn't attempt to be a heart-warming story or a contendor for the Oscars, all it attempts to be is a Mexploitation film which is full of action, blood and laughs. And in that context, it succeeds. It's about time Danny Trejo got the leading role for a movie, he's 66 and been in over 100 films, yet this is his first leading role in a film. Robert Rodriguez especially rewards him, by having him get in a pool with a naked Lindsey Lohan and her naked onscreen mom. The action in this film may seem a bit over the top, but the great thing is that the film revels in being over the top, it is quite in vein of the old B movies. In one scene he attaches a machine gun to a motorbike and rides it high into the sky, with an explosion behind him, taking down about ten guys at once. In fact, heres a link to that particular scene http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0JCB24Ld8 This film has a wicked sense of humour.

One guard then remarks \""""""""You ever noticed how you let a Mexican into your house just because he's got gardening tools? No questions asked, you just let him right in. Could have a chainsaw. You know, a machete...\"""""""". They then realise what he's said, and have their asses handed to them by Machete. Later the guards (still alive) talk about how people are fine with Mexicans working for them, yet not with letting them live in this country, and when Machete returns, one guard just proclaims \""""""""I quit!\"""""""" and hands Machete his gun, making the smart choice and walking out alive.

The film itself does have an acquired taste, its often slow and many will find it difficult to sit through, simply for the lack of what people may perceive to be very little happening, but thats the point of it, letting the talent tell the story through actions, facial expressions and decisions, this man constantly fears for his life, even though his past suggests he can handle the pressure, we see a broken and often paranoid individual, a human being.

I'd say it's more like a first-and-a-half. Pixar is still the animation powerhouse, but Dreamworks has been doing very well. Stereotypical (yet likeable) characters and a predictable story didn't hurt this one at all, in my opinion. I loved Toothless (the Dragon). He didn't utter a single word, yet I could see every emotion that went through his mind. And Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) was a fine lead. There was nothing extremely inventive in his looser-becomes-hero character, but I still liked him alot. I pretty much liked everything else about this one too. Gerard Butler would be just as good a Viking in live action, as he was in this one. It was just like King Leonidas put on a few pounds. And I have to mention Craig Ferguson. I watch his late night show every once in a while, and the guy is hilarious. I loved seeing (well technically hearing) him in a good movie. If there happens to be a sequel (like that would ever happen), he better be there. Like I mentioned before, the story is a bit cliche, but it was still a fun, heart warming tale. I loved how this movie leaned more towards drama and action, than comedy. That really made this a unique experience to me. The 3D was beautiful too. It was more like Avatar's, with depth. Finally a 3D animated movie that doesn't throw stuff at you for an hour and a half! This story would be amazing in any D, but if you can, go see it in 3D.

And in The Town, Ben Affleck revisits his hometown to do nothing more than talk trash on it. He must've really hated this town because both of his movies portrayed nothing but evil of Boston. Nevertheless, The Town is beautifully directed, written with great wit, and acted with much style. The story centers around a bunch of bank robbers who have been successful at what they are doing. But the success comes to an end when Doug (Ben Affleck) decided to have a relationship with hostage Clairre (Rebecca Hall). As the relationship develops, Clairre finds out that Doug is a bank robber and it gets complicated. Meanwhile, Doug was having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's sister Krista (Blake Lively). Being jealous of Clairre, Krista decided to rat Doug and her brother's bank heist to the FBI resulting in a lot of stylized gun fires and great driving scenes. The end is obvious but it has a sad element that Ben Affleck wants the viewers to feel. Writing, acting, and directing the whole film, Affleck's got a lot on his table but still manages to pull off every single role. As a writer, along with two others, Affleck was able to collaborate his knowledge of the Boston language and the wit of actual screen writing. As a director, he was able to direct a great gun fire sequence and a stylish car driving scene. As an actor, Affleck's performance would place second behind Jeremy Renner's. The Oscar winner continues to boost up his already impressive career with The Town. Jeremy Renner isn't new to playing a **** yet violent guy, but he especially stood out here with his badass attitude. Blake Lively's role was small but she gave it her all. You couldn't see her cuss in a Boston accent and have sex with Ben Affleck in Gossip Girl, could you? Well, there's the other reason to check it out. While filled with much thrillers, the film also showed emotions. Helped by one of this year's best ensembled cast and stylish directing by Ben Affleck, The Town is an award-winning film.

His dad and his friends, all around him, their life mission is to kill dragons and Hiccup is expected to do the same. Going through training and a lot of trying, Hiccup was not successful.

Zombieland shows the ongoing zombie apocalypse, from the point of view of four characters. Nervous Columbus is the typical unlikely hero, but he and his list are entertaining to watch, especially when the many items pop up at various places throughout the movie. Woody Harrelson basically steals the film as gun-toting, Twinkie loving Tallahassee. His dialogue sparks. The revealation that he lost his son really makes you feel for the character. The sisters, Little Rock and Witchita, run cons on the two males many times through the movie, with them stealing the boys trucks three times. Their chemistry really sparks, and you believe that these two could be sisters, as they set off through the zombie wasteland to visit the theme park they enjoyed back in happier times. And the cameo! Bill Murray appears, scaring Tallahassee and Witchita as he pretends to be a zombie. His cameo was seriously genius, making you laugh throughout all of his scenes. Tallahassee going all geek boy during meeting him is funny as, with them smoking from a bong, to dressing up as ghostbusters. Shame Columbus accidently shoots him, thinking he was really a zombie. To be honest, if Zombies do infest the world, there should be a lot more. Especially running to Tallahassee when hes unloading bullets after finding the redneck truck. Also, some of Columbus' early dialogue had me cringing a bit. The finale: Fighting zombies at the amusement park, from Talahassee on the rollercoaster to locked in the booth whilst surrounded, this ranks up there with the best film zombie fights. Gotta love when the zombies chasing after Columbus get hit by the swinging ride (dunno its name). And the zombie clown. Win! All in all, this was a brilliant zombie film.

It's amazing to watch this, think of when it came out, and still see how all zombie fiction is using the exact same ideas.

Night of the Living Dead holds up remarkably well after all these years. If anything, with the exception of (maybe) the low budget and some inexperienced acting, time might have actually improved this movie. It's black and white visuals, retro soundtrack, and to the basics approach add a tone and atmosphere to this that the refinements of the modern age can't always capture. I will admit that there is a lot of what I guess you could call empty space in the movie. The majority of the time is just watching the characters (mostly just Ben) board up the house they are trying to survive in. It isn't until the cast expands that the action really starts to get going. Like most zombie movies, the struggle survivors find between each other as the result of differing backgrounds and personality is just as large and dangerous to them as that of the undead hoards gathering just outside their defenses. One of the many examples I could cite to show you just how influential this movie was to the countless others of it's ilk that followed in suit."""""""", """"""""While the low budget, independent nature of the film is something of a two-edged sword, it's clear that one edge is much sharper than the other. Fortunately, it's the one the swordsman doesn't have to worry about cutting (or worse, impaling) himself on. Without a great deal of special effects to rely on, we actually get to see the cast really use tools like fire and such to survive. It's pretty amazing to see our lead use a legitimate torch indoors, smoke and all, on his was outside. It makes the situation more believable. Yes, he's not actually going out there to ward off zombies, but he is risking some burns with that flame. The movie might actually be even creepier due to this smaller scale as well. I particularly enjoyed how the zombies were portrayed without much makeup, making them look more like, well, people. It's their behavior that sets them apart. I also think the way Romero envisioned them is also neat. They are much smarter then what we normally see nowadays, as they have the gumption to do things use tools in basic ways. It's also worth noting how incredibly bleak things are. With it's unforgettable ending and disturbing basement scenes, this is a movie that will stick with you long after you've made it to the final screen. Unlike other zombie fiction, this one even gives us an idea as to what caused the dead to return to feast on the living. Night of the Living Dead is a piece of cinema history. A real game changer that is still influencing the world today. Even though the zombie craze has slowed down a bit as of recently, the undead are still dominating our world. Well, ladies and gentlemen this is where the outbreak started. The late, great George Romero has gone down in history for a reason. You really should check out this starting movie in a series that has still has the ability to enchant and chill even today. Zombie fan or not, horror fan or not, movie buff or not, if you consider yourself a fan of fine cinema then this a must watch. Not only is it historic, but it's also fantastic as well.

Plus it also gives us the birth of darth vader, and luke and leia. Its has been said to kinda have an emotional black hole, but that is not true as Anakin turning to the dark side made obi-wan very sad, yoda falls to the ground as he senses all of the jedi dying. I also love how Jar Jar is only in one scene of the movie, and has doesn't speak a word, which is the second best part because I hate Jar Jar.

They sit and play video games, Shaun goes to work and is made fun of by his much younger colleagues, while also going through his life in sort of auto-pilot mode of repeating the same at ions day in and day out. The excellent refreshment of the film stems from what is really a subplot, that lead have risen as zombies and are eating the living, yet the constant bickering of these three, along with Liz's friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran) takes centre stage as they attempt to come up with plans at every turn in an attempt to get through a situation. The dark humour is particularly well written from Pegg and Wright, who also directs the film, his fast-paced and energetic style of filming adds heightened tension to otherwise menial scenes, these are definitely callbacks to zombie films of old, they need to get to a safe haven, which Shaun and Ed believe to be the local pub of course, is it so wrong to sit in relative comfort and drink free booze until an apocalypse blows over?  The human element feels grounded and doesn't give way to too much zombie time, we get various situations of such routine where we even see Shaun walk to the shop and back without even noticing the people around him where zombies, it was funny, but it also showed a message of just how familiar people will be that we don't even notice change right in front of us. The witty britishness of it all is particularly fresh, a cup of tea will fix everything, while even in the most frightening of circumstances, jokes bar regulars and dead people not being your real dad can still hold a dark sense of comic relief, especially in a time of zombie overkill in the film industry, no pun intended. We have chemistry and urgency with the characters to get the point across, Pegg and Frost are the perfect duo, no matter how much Shaun wants to change, he can't say no to his best friend.

Spurlock goes at it on a personal level, combining very candid video logs while also taking an honest approach to the effects of his new diet, such as his sex life. His new regime is making a thirty day diet consist entirely of McDonalds food and drink for his three meals per day. He goes through all the routine health tests before embarking on his experiment. While he does it, we also get to know the fast food giant that is Ronald and his french fries, while also asking passers-by how often they eat such greasy goodness, but more difficult questions like, What is a calorie? The results after mere days are quite startling, as Morgan eats his first Super Size meal and in turn vomits most of it back up again, the deterioration of his health in a mere two weeks is astounding, and the facts are equally disturbing, showing just how much more is now available than 20 years ago. Where the challenge seems to take its starter from was a court case that was going on from two young girls who claimed that McDonalds was the cause of their obesity, through large consumptions. Morgan tries tirelessly to get a meeting with the McDonalds bigwigs but is unsuccessful. The film is a true and often gobsmacking account at just how much damage people are doing to their bodies with that Big Mac or two, it shows the immediate impact of the media and how various celebrities are called upon for soft drink or fast food placements to help the sales, but it simply doesn't matter, the money is still made.  Spurlock worries all those around him with his drastic health change and it really hits home just how quickly things can change, but also just how much is in one of those meals.

It would have been harder to overlook the nonsensical moments the director throws in or his intentionally cheap, amateurish camera work (most evident in the way it pans the screen). All of which feels kind of pretentious. The remarkable thing is that none of this really feels all that far out of Sandler's wheelhouse. It's not the majority of the stuff he's been in hasn't had him playing as a character with anger problems before. The difference is that the material here is just deeper and requires more range from him. It's amazing that more people aren't taking advantage of this. That they can't see what Anderson saw in him. I don't blame other people in Hollywood kind of losing faith in him and not wanting to give him a chance based on all those critically panned comedies he's made over the years. Especially lately where even as a fan I have to admit he hasn't been trying as hard as he used to. Still, it's not as though he hasn't come out of his comfort zone following this. He's shown he can rise to the occasion for more serious material in film's like Reign Over Me or Spanglish, among others. Come one people, throw the man a bone.

The movie even manages to get it out of him while playing to a few of his expected strengths in the process. Simply put, the movie gives one of cinema's biggest critical punching bags some good material from a proven director and lets us watch him rise to the occasion.

Al Pacino plays the gruff and seasoned detective sent to the mountainous regions of Alaska to investigate the murder of a young teen girl, but we immediately begin to understand the life of Pacinos character, Will Dormer. He knows the ins and outs of how to study a crime scene, looking for the little details, but he also seems exhausted, soaking up life through routine as a man who has seen it all, tired, possibly bored but still able to show up the young blood at any given turn. His younger partner Eckhart (Martin Donovan) respects the decisions of his superior, but he also has the opportunity to give evidence against his older counterpart to Internal Affairs, but their motive in the film is to help out with the murder, where Dormor finds a fan on young and motivated cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), hangs onto every word of the ageing detective. But we he an unexpected and thrilling introduction to the person responsible for the crime, ***SPOILERS*** Dormor and his men stakeout a clue and tragedy strikes when Dormor shoots and kills his partner, this was an accident, right? Dormor is overcome with guilt to the point where he cannot admit his mistake, but one person knows what he did, that person is the man responsible for the young girls death. Robin Williams plays the calm and sophisticated writer, who tells Dormor that it was all an accident, we now have a cat and mouse game, the scenes Pacino and Williams share are excellent, two fine actors, Williams in particular, who proves his talent yet again for dramatic roles, but this style of storytelling is truly fascinating because of its revelations halfway through the film, which are brought down by simplistic and routine Hollywood chase sequences and silly throw-ins to give that blockbuster touch, which are unnecessary, especially when the thrill of the chase, all through dialogue and performances, is already so interesting. Pacino is excellent as the now sleep-deprived cop, who can't even rest away from the world, while Williams plays a cunning adversary who has it all worked out, as he keeps telling us, but its rough justice which wins out, Nolan sets it in remote parts to capture the essence of being alone with your thoughts, while still not escaping the ramifications of something that makes you run away."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

These men don't know each other, but they share chemistry over coffee, but we soon learn that they have reason for being there, a jewellery story heist that we see in flashbacks, because for most of the film, we have a lot of dialogue taking place in the warehouse that was the agreed rendezvous, but you can now judge from this wording that it all goes horribly wrong, and as a few start to appear at the warehouse with various theories as to what went wrong, the most prominent of these being an informant within the pack, injuries and deaths have happened, and now they must find out what truth there is to the 'rat' business. The unfortunate shortcomings of the film lie with its characters having little intrigue or prospect about them, the plot revolves around them, but at the same time it revolves more around trying to find out what went wrong, the plot is intriguing, but not enough time is spent working up a point to each 'colour', each man being called a different one so as to protect their names, but that isn't to say the performances aren't immense, with Madsen almost stealing the show with his cold and collective attitude, each time he's about to speak is edgy because of his unpredictability and menacing demeanour. Keitel is the level headed one who looks after Roths character after he is shot. There are plenty of surprises and shocks along the way, while introductions to the characters through flashbacks intertwine well with the main arc of the warehouse, but we don't have particularly witty or mesmerising dialogue, the script relies on its characters and its conclusion of figuring out the problems of the heist. Tarantino is a proven marvel when it comes to unique filmmaking, this film was the kick off to some dark humour such as Madsens \""""""""Mr Blonde\"""""""" toying with his victim as he dances to \""""""""Stealers Wheel\"""""""", it funny but frightening, we have no idea what is about to happen, and Tarantino has carried on this witty and quick fire shooting that captures smaller but significant details that matter. This isn't his finest work, but here we get a crisp and sharp introduction to the technique and capabilities of Tarantino, he assembles quite the sought after cast with equally impressive performances, and a soundtrack that works well with the darkly humorous script, not as tight as it should be but still a cut above most, it talks perhaps a little too much, but never becomes boring or stale."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

Macy), a tightly wound middle-aged man who wants out of the family business, he openly tells his therapist that he gets paid to kill people, here we see a dark and witty approach at how the film will play out. Macy has been raised in the family business by his father (Donald Sutherland) who was a hitman, much like Alex, but Alex wants to move on with his life, he wants to stop lying to his wife and spend more time with his funny and curious son, Sammy (David Dorfman). Macy has the ability to bring a certain type of sadness to a role that reeks of unhappiness and humility, his talent for this has never been more apparent, he's still stuck in his fathers shadow and unable to tell him he wants out.

Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in many ways.    It is highly entertaining, throughout. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.    Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly \""""""""summer popcorn action flick\"""""""", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though.    I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.    My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great.    I was really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how i felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it. I cannot wait for Iron Man 2. I'm hoping that it repeats the cycle of great comic book movie sequels. Following in the footsteps of X2, Spider-man 2, The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk (if you consider that a sequel), and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (just kidding)."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

Along the way, they come across an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) Let me get this out of the way: Just because the two main characters are \""""""""nerds\"""""""" doesn't mean anyone who isn't one will be alienated. The jokes are crude, often come flying fast and there's enough within this movie so everyone will be entertained, including car chases, romance subplots, star wars (amongst other films) references and explosions. The jokes can often be crude, yes, but there's no doubt about how many laughs inhabit each joke: they're full of them. From probing gags to tri-titted aliens, this film is certainly a barrel full of laughs (there are better jokes, but its hard to speak of them without spoiling parts of the movie). There are a few jokes where you just have to give yourself a second to process what the character just said, and when you have processed what they just said, trust me, you'll be laughing. This film proudly bears its inspirations, by homaging some films which, trust me, once you hear them, you'll get the homage. The best homage? Listen to the background music when the characters enter the redneck bar, you'll see. Also, once Sigourney Weaver makes her on screen appearance, wait for a certain line to be referenced. I can't talk about this movie without mentioning the films title character: Paul. Seth Rogens voice doesn't bother me in any way, in fact, his voice seems perfectly suited for the CGI character, who does not stick out like a sorethumb like certain cgi-characters *cough*ScoobyDoo*cough* In fact, all of the characters are quite well done characters, none feeling like merely one dimensional characters, whether its Jane Lynch's alien enthusiast waitress, or David Koenchers redneck who severly dislikes the title characters, they also manage to pull of some brilliant laughs. A great deal of the laughs have to come from the Goverment agents, played by Bill Hader and Lo Trugillo. The duo give us some big laughs, whether its about 'Spacemans balls', searching the main characters RV or within a comic book store, you can expect big laughs from these two. Paul manages to go in a direction that i'm glad it touched upon, the creationism VS evolution debate. With Paul suddenly here, it fuels the debate (not through the whole movie though) and ponders the idea of what to do when you're beliefs have been shattered. So basically, Paul is a film filled with non-stop laughs, a brilliant cast who could act their way out of a prison and homages that are guarranteed to leave a smile on your face.

With a thrilling and perplexed performance by Natalie Portman, and stylish directing from Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan can go far. The story is more complicated than you think it is. It is not just about a ballet dancer, it is about a ballet dancer with deep mental issues. Nina is professional ballet dancer who got promoted to play the key role in a ballet performance, the Swan Queen. With a lot of pressure on her, the story proposes that she is obviously hallucinating about her body being deform. At first, I thought all of this was real because Natalie Portman is so believable. But as the story developed, I know for a fact that this girl has some serious mental issues. A summary about the film really doesn't do it justice, go watch it and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Black Swan demonstrates how ballet is as exciting and thrilling as an action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Natalie Portman might even win the Best Actress Oscar, that is if she beat Annette Bening (but she already locked herself an Oscar nod).

Even though the movies were made to satisfy the fans, but its main reason was to make more money with Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. We'd watched all three of them grow for a decade, now to think that they're all adults and the franchise is going to be over soon, it is an odd feeling to say the least. The wizard world is corrupting because Lord Voldemort is back with his powers. Even the Ministry of Magic has to hide. The movie takes us on a journey with the three friends rather than giving us a battle between Harry and Voldemort. This is the number one reason fans are complaining about: there wasn't enough action and adventure. But in my opinion, the movie is just building tension for the next one. Even though the film doesn't give much on action, the acting is perfectly where we want it. The three friends give it their all but standing out is Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and his evil companion Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter).

The film has centred itself around the African-American maids predominantly working in Jackson, Mississippi as they carefully detail their day to day lives working for the white women of the town, they do so through the energetic and openness of Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone), who sets out to write a book anonymously to highlight the situations these women endure. This is a definitely a safe film, and while does tend to only touch on some of the ugly and chaotic times of the era, it also seems like this was intentional, instead offering the good that can come out a situation such as this, it is willing to show great emotion while also keeping themes arms length, it delves and paddles its feet slightly on racial abuse but never plunges too deep. Skeeter sets her sights on two maids to begin her book, her backstory showing that she has difficulty fitting into the society she once lived in, these two maids are Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). As wonderful an actress as Emma Stone is, the film belongs to these tow characters, they could have easily won out the entire show on their own."""""""", """"""""The former is really the centre of the story, as she is the first to speak to Skeeter, we are immediately shown the life she leads as she raises the young children of the family she works for, and watches them grow up to be exactly the way their mothers are, We can see from the excellent performance of Davis that Aibileen is tired of being treated like a pet, the leader of the ladies in the social circle is Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the snake of the town, campaigning behind a smile to have separate bathrooms for the maids so as they don't use their own, Minny is the comic relief and hearty force of the film, as she is fired by Hilly and in turn goes to work for the outcast of this social circle, Celia Foot (Jessica Chastain), who treats Minny as an equal, albeit with quite the quirky and unhinged personality to go along with her generosity. Each one of the characters immediately invite us into their lives, Aibileen struggles with a previous tragedy that eventually drives her to talk to Skeeter, considering the risks involved in speaking ill of their employers, bug they aren't always doing that, there are plenty of happy memories, especially Skeeter and her family maid Constantine, a story which also holds a touching and heartbreaking premise. The excellent performances of Davis and Spencer are the hallmarks of this colourful and vibrant setting, it's short on make roles but never feels overly feminine, instead choosing to (inadvertently) have Aibileen as the centrepiece of the show, with Chastains character and the story of Skeeters maid taking a smaller but equally touching subplot. This is happy and moving film that can be a little rough around the edges with some devices belonging in a different film, but the performances of Davis and Spencer are of the highest order, their characters each have a life outside of their jobs which feature prominently but don't overshadow their desire for change, it's a different sort of take on a cruel and often tragic era in history, one which doesn't cover all the holes but certainly fills the relevant ones with humour and heartfelt decency."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

Third, the idea of gothic mixed with science gives the film a fresh air and it is reflected in the moment when the other boys have their experiments. The thing here is that with these series of creatures, we notice the different approaches to science: love of Victor, ignorance of Edgar, over-confidence of Toshiaki, superiority of Nassor, fear of Bob and accident of Weird Girl. Other great things on this movie are the use of Frankenstein elements and the outstanding application of camera, in the picture are noticeable transitions from one images to another, flip over (360 turn) and the famous vertigo effect, formed by simultaneously dolly in and zoom out.

But these bikers don't seem to risk their lives for the mediocre pay, but more for the thrill and to get there on time. But pretty soon, many others get involved in this game of cat and mouse including Wilee's on/off girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) who is also under the watchful eye of the physically impressive Manny (Wolé Parks) who competes time and time again with Wilee, but as mentioned, they all have their part to play when the stage is set for thee faster paced finale. This is a chase movie first and foremost, with some excellent effects as Wilee judges his route, one can only applaud the stunt doubles used throughout the film, the chase sequences are intense and full of life, but this is isn't an insightful or a film with profound meaning, it's all for the entertainment and for this reason, it succeeds in every way."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

When he or his son gets hungry, he looks for food scraps or steals from a store. If he needs money, he works in whatever it takes, no matter if other people get hurt.

Mud feels art house, but it also hints towards mainstream elements, either way it throws some interesting characters into one big pot, each with their own problems and difficulties in life, age not being a factor. Although the title refers to the character Matthew McConaughey portrays, there's also two young boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are two young boys who have a knack for going out in little adventures, one which brings them to a secluded island in the waters of Arkansas, where they live. On said island, they try to claim ownership of a stranded boat high in trees, but they soon realise that they aren't the only ones who know about the boat, Mud comes into their life with his unkempt hair, heavy southern accent and aspirations of meeting his one true love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but when love is involved, it isn't usually savoury or happy trials ahead. Ellis in particular is young boy with all the problems in front of him, parents possibly getting divorced, learning about love and even heartbreak for the first time. The story of Ellis and Mud are mirrored in a deliberate and intriguing tale, they share similar experiences and the film seems to be showing what Mud's life was like as a younger person, perhaps showing the mistakes he made and how to steer Ellis away from making the same ones. This is the sort of film where many will judge the character of Mud, to many he will still be a murderer on the run, no matter his excuses, but to others he will be the man looking out for his girl, even if she doesn't show the same gratitude. The height of brilliance in the storytelling from writer and director Jeff Nichols strong and inspirational throughout the film, he paints a sort of prophet in Mud who isn't necessarily delusional, but more like someone who has hit rock bottom already and doesn't really know where else to go but up."""""""", """"""""The most catching part of the film is its originality, no adaptions or anything of the sort, films these days to be literal in the sense of having a book to centre a story around, but this one, these characters are equally as significant as any black and white one, Ellis and Neckbone are smart kids, but they buy into Mud and his smooth talking plans too easily, each person who has known Mud before the two boys has had little redeeming things to say about him, but Ellis continues to return to him and help him, regardless of the consequences. My only gripe with an otherwise impeccable film is an ending that doesn't quite fit, a shootout that offers no real conclusive finish, only an opportunity for some wounds to heal."""""""", """"""""But other than that, Mud is easily the most touching of films that is completely original, it's forthright in its approach to how we perceive human beings who have perhaps gone off track a little, but also how the most unlikely of people can put them back on the right path, McConaughey at his finest with a very convincing performance from Sheridan, it's wisdom at its toughest and brilliance in its own artful way."""""""" ]"""""",0,1,0,1"

"avatar,9,roddersj04,/user/roddersj04,""Jan  1, 2011"",""""""[ """"""""I'll admit, with all of the hype that surrounded this film, I was sceptical as to how good it could actually be, and was waiting for it to fail. Oh, how wrong was I? Avatar is a brilliant film. I saw this in 3D earlier this year, and in 2D just the other day, so I feel I can give a review that isn't biased with just one setting of the films view. I'll just clear the air, state the obvious here and leave it in the dust: The film in 3D is an AMAZING experience. The way in which you see these spectacles James Cameron has created, it will burn itself into your memory in a good way. 2D has you focus less on the spectacles and more on things like the story and the characters. Now, to the films actual review Avatar is the tale of Jake Sully, a soldier who takes over from his dead brother on a science project, which temporarily has his mind transferred into an Avatar body, to help the military in their quest to take a substance from Pandora (the planet). From there on, he lives amongst the Na'vi (the race the Avatar body is based upon) and begins doubting where his allegiance lies. I'll admit, the plot isn't anything complex or original. It's been done before, and you can basically guess where the plot's going to go. \""""""""They're gonna rebel\"""""""" \""""""""His truth will be discovered\"""""""" \""""""""He's gonna question his motives\"""""""". And you knew they only introduced the Toruk so Jake could master it. Also, was I the only one who didn't like the guy playing the boss? I mean, he was great in Friends and My Name Is Earl, in comedy roles, but for something serious like this, it just didn't seem to suit him. And the oxygen on Pandora was toxic to the humans. How exactly does it work? Stephen Lang's character had quite a time of exposure to it (when chasing them escaping on the helicopter, when he shot Grace) and seemed fine. And Jake as well. He was exposed for an amount of time, possibly longer, and ended up fine. Anyway, thats the negatives out of the way. Now the positives The world of Pandora and its inhabitants was a marvel to behold, even in 2D. James Cameron has a very creative mind. Just look at all of the creatures, from the Hammerheads, to the four-armed monkeys. Not just that, the technology as well.How info could be moved from one screen to another with just a flick of the wrist, and the handcuffs. I'll say it again, James Cameron is one creative guy, with one hell of an imagination. Shame about his acceptance speeches, though..... The way CGI contrasted with the humans. It didn't seem to contrast much. When (Avatar) Jake was carrying Grace, it didn't seem like one big clash of reality and Computer Generated Images, they seamed together perfectly, like two pieces of a puzzle clicking together. I liked how the characters developed. How Grace went from a no-nonsense **** to how she was warm and a good friend to Jake and Norm. I especially liked how Norm changed from a goofy scientist to him punching out officers and joining in the big battle. The final battle: What a marvel! Just the contrast of the flying Dragons (or whatever they are) versus the gunships. Just basically how it was Nature VS Machinery. I think it's safe to say that there was no shortage of awesomeness within that battle. Shame Tsu'tey was killed off. Just as I was getting to like him. Once Jake first woke up in his Avatar, when he first went from standing up to running through the outdoors, I felt for him because in human form, he's confined to that wheelchair, but as a Na'vi, he's no longer confined. I also felt James Cameron placed some parallels for the Iraq war within the movie. One group going to another land in order to take something that they wish, resulting in a battle. And Stephen Lang! His turn as a villian is quite menacing, especially in the cold hearted way he just bombs the Tree, the home of the Na'vi. I felt that he was the perfect counterfoil for Sam Worthington's Jake Sully. All in all: It may seem like it mainly concentrates on the visuals, and it's plot development may be by numbers, but this is definately a film you must watch!"""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

There's still some morals running in the back, but it's handled as lightly as possible so that the sweet parts are pushed to the front and the more uncomfortable ones are cut out completely. So the question remains, is Boo! funny? Yes, in face it is. Maybe even much more so than you would expect. The jokes come about a mile a minute. The majority of them hit their mark even if the movie has a tendency to rely on characters just saying the same thing repeatedly with in their characters weird voices. For those who watch Madea movies as a family, I think it's worth mentioning this is probably the crudest Madea I've seen thus far. I'll admit that I've only watched a few of these movies and it's been a while since I have. However, I don't remember them having this much profanity at this level. Not as many innuendos either.

Struggling families are nothing new to horror films, but rarely these days are their struggles so well realized. We witness genuinely fleshed out characters that are backed up by great performances. Little touches of humor and heart add believability to the situation. The set up about these characters running a scam about being able to contact the dead in order to just get by, and then coming across real trouble when they are actually able to make contact is a great one. It's also a very effective prequel tale that ties into it's (awful) predecessor nicely. I don't recommend watching that movie to see for yourself though. Just stick with this one."""""""", """"""""A perfect example of how something good can come out of something really, really bad. At least when the situation is in the right hands that is. Mike Flanagan outdoes himself by rising above what could have been a simple paycheck and a awfully delivered movie like the first Ouija, and goes out of his way to create another truly great modern horror movie. It may be lacking in actual scares, but it certainly tries harder than the average flick in the genre that hits the screen these days. Give it a shot.

I choose Captain America not just because it's his movie, it's that he is doing it for justice and that's what I love about Captain America. I mean I don't want to flame if you join Iron Man, but that's with me. If I had to versus this to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War will win 100%. No one was expecting this at all (especially Spider-Man being a show stealer) and that's how Captain America: Civil War becomes another recipe for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a fresh start to the third phrase. It also introduces Black Panther to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. In any way, this felt more like an \""""""""Avengers 2.5\"""""""" movie than a normal Captain America movie, but I still love it regardless of the entire situation.

Using a bus to slingshot a car into druggie bad guys and into a store, causing an explosion, now THATS an opening sequence. Martin and Fosse are the rivals of Hoitz and Gamble, leading to a silent fight at a wake with characters whispering insults and momentarily stopping to pay condolences. They also get some killer dialogue, whether its cornering a villian (\""""""""I hope you like the taste of prison food...and penis\"""""""") or talking about their weekend. \""""""""So then what happened?\"""""""" \""""""""What do you think happened? I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, got in my car, and got out of there.\"""""""" \""""""""Talk about a wild weekend\"""""""" \""""""""I thought I was going to have to shoot my way out, hahahaha ...what are you going to do though, you know ...bar mitzvah's\"""""""" They have an especially funny scene in a classroom of 10 year olds, which is probably my favourite scene in the film, and their retorts about the coke-covered car were especially funny. Of course, the two main characters get their share of funny dialogue also, whether its Will Ferrells quote about how a tuna would beat a lion in a fight or groaning about how walking away from explosions are BS. Its not just the quotes which are funny about them, as Gamble is revealed to have shot Derek Jeter in a flashback (\""""""""He's a bi-racial angel\"""""""") and Terry gets his gun taken away and given a wooden gun, only to have the wooden gun taken and given a rape whistle. All of the actors play their roles well, (after Planet of the Apes and The Happening, you'll be surprised Mark Whalberg plays a role well) and Steve Coogan definatley does well as the troubled business man. Even the one scene characters like Christinith and her hairy (or not) husband do well when they are showed, even if they provide nothing to the plot but comedic foil. As you can see, I loved a lot about this film. But not everything worked. Bits that didn't work for me? The relationship between Terry and his wife (Eva Mendez) wasn't really funny, it was essentially him saying his hot wife was plain and treated her unspectacularly. Granted, I liked their last scene where he made amends with her and admitted he couldn't believe she was with him, and sending the granny out to relay their dirty messages had me laughing, but the bits before didn't make me laugh. Making Terry a pimp back in college seems to be an idea which is great when you say it out loud, but when executed you seem a little dissapointed. Also, Will Ferrell didn't even convince as a college guy, he just looked like a 40 something man retaking college, but thats a minor niggle. Also, the scene where Allen is jealous over his wife taking ballet with another guy (I assume that was her instructor). Will Ferrell livened up that scene, and Allens good ballet dancing was a laughable surprise, but the rest of the scene just didn't work for me. All in all, this film isn't as good as Anchorman, but it certainly beats the dire Cop-Out. Definately a brilliant action comedy"""""""" ]"""""",1,1,1,0"

The admirable aspect of Caines performance is his ability to control his character throughout the film, he doesn't conform to a bloodthirsty animal seeking justice, he shows his age but uses it to his advantage to cut a more rugged and emotionally-driven man, Caine never acts out or completely changes what is or isn't moral, he simply has bottled up fear and anger which now surfaces in mighty swoosh, he has stood by too long and watched as many of his neighbours are beaten, harassed and sometimes murdered by the violent criminals who have taken over, his friend makes the mistake of confronting these people and ends up losing his life, but the last straw for Harry is when the case against those who are believed to have committed the crime, nay get away with a manslaughter charge instead of murder because of the weapon Harry's friend, Len (David Bradley) was carrying. The film takes a smart and character driven approach as Harry is an easily approachable man who seemingly just wants a quiet life to grieve for his wife, but the gang, led by actor/rapper Ben Drew/Plan B will not let anyone rest, this involves some very graphic content throughout the film, at its highest effectiveness when shown as a form of mobile phone footage. A scene where he attempts to buy a gun from two crazed drug dealers, where he sees a helpless woman off her head, we then see the ex-marine that we have heard about throughout the film. On the tail of Harry is detective Frampton (Emily Mortimer) who feels sympathy and cuts a very weary and fed up individual, but she won't let a vigilante do her job for her. She can see who may be responsible but can't do much about it at that moment. We then see a third act unfold which takes a realistic approach, the police get involved which erupts into a messy riot, but this has relatable tendencies and doesn't turn into a blockbuster showdown, the film keeps playing its cards close to the chest right until the credits role, we get a good sense if closure but not that of complete eradication, this highlights the real problem of crime, dramatised in the film for effect of course, but outlines a real problem of always being scared."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

The Day After Tomorrow was decent, and 2012 wasn't the best, but at least it got me entertained with its science like Godzilla. However, one of his best works yet is a sci-fi action flick known as Independence Day. It revolves around an alien invasion on earth as a group of humans set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. We already know what it was about because we have seven days until Independence Day as a great holiday. Now I'm going to make my opinion. The only problem that I had with this movie was the special effects. They were kind of cheesy as if they came from the 1970s. As for the rest of the movie, everything turned out great. The acting was terrific, the sci-fi action was pretty damn cool, the storyline was well-paced, the stunts were very cool, and the music score from David Arnold was amazing. Three days ago, there has been great news that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have planned to make not only Independence Day 2, but Independence Day 3 as well and Will Smith will return for those sequels. I bid these guys good luck as Independence Day is not only one the best action movies of all time, but one of the best ones yet. Thumbs up from me. P.S.

The original is worth 6 at most, the 8 is for the Directors Cut version, which is better than the original cinematic version. For the Directors Cut, a sub-plot is added where Matt and Foggy Nelson take the case of a murdered prostitute, with a drug addict framed for the murder, played by Coolio. This addition makes the film seem darker than the original cut. Foggy Nelson is given more to do than be just the lawyers sidekick and we get more time with Matt Murdock as a lawyer than a masked vigilante. Also, the reason the cops come for Kingpin at the end seems more believable than in the original cut. The opening origin is extended, focusing more upon Matts catholic upbringing and making us feel more for his relationship with his father, which makes it more tragic when his father is murdered. However, many flaws still remain. The playground fight scene's a big one, and you can't help but feel that Jennifer Gardners casting as Elektra was just stunt casting, due to her being in Alias. I personally liked Colin Farrels portrayal as Bullseye. He plays the character crazy and enjoyable, just like Bullseye. I feel they missed a trick though. When Bullseye asks Kingpin for a costume, that was the right moment for Bullseye to get his Marvel costume. But seeing Ben Afflecks gimpy DD costume and the schoolgirl Elektra, maybe a Bullseye costume was better left undone. Michael Clarke Duncan will always be John Coffey off the Green Mile for me, so I'm not fully convinced as him playing Kingpin. I was convinced in his battle with Daredevil and him talking with Bullseye, but not much else. And Ben Affleck as Daredevil? I honestly didn't mind him. Who would've thought the addition of Coolio would help this become a better film? Still confounded by Ben Urich finding the gasoline/alcohol marked DD which he set on fire..."""""""" ]"""""",20,27,20,7"

It takes a natural approach to the subject of how someone would react to living the same day over and over again, the first step is shock and disbelief, but onwards its fun and reaping the rewards of an unexplainable phenomenon, that's exactly what weatherman Phil (Murray) experiences as he covers Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania, he is a confident, egotistical and charming man who meets producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) who sees right through Phil and his over-zealous personality. As he begins to relive the same day, he starts to use it to his advantage to try and woo Rita, this is where we begin to see Phil seeing the error of his ways and his attempts to try and change his life. Murray brings real charisma and vintage charm to a simple role, his timing and reaction is in full force here where he uses his repetition of days for selfish means and also to impress flabbergasted onlookers for his 'predictions' of Jeopardy. This is an interesting tale of how repetition and routine can change ones outlook in their own life, whether they feel meaningless or not, it also shows the impact that he can have on others, but it also studies the fact that everyone has the room for change and never to settle for the same old thing, even though he sees it day after day. While the film can be too deliberately paced for some, it explores each avenue of such a life-changing event even if it happens again and again, realising the people closest to him matter most, whether co-workers or even homeless strangers, he tries to change everyone's life even in the smallest of ways."""""""", """"""""This is a funny, touching and equally as inspirational piece of cinema that takes risks in the repetitive nature but ultimately pays off to see the change in one person, Bill Murray couldn't have been more likeable or sincere in his delivery as he struggles with not knowing how to get out of the rut he is in, and how to convince other people to see the change in him."""""""" ]"""""",1,2,1,1"

We have familiar faces in Josh Brolin and Sam Astin in their much younger days, the latter playing young Mikey, a kid with breathing problems who talks fast and seems to be the level headed one of the bunch, until he begins to start chasing treasure in the hope finding something to save his town, which is about to be demolished. His older brother Brand, played by Brolin, loves his brother but doesn't agree with his childish adventures, but Mikey and his friends manage to embark on their adventure in a very accidental way, unearthing secrets they never imagined before. A series of traps and willpower test these young explorers as they dig deeper into centuries old secrets.

It revolves around Lyra Belaqua, a young girl living among scholars in Oxford's Jordan College. Her world may seem diverse, from physical embodiments of souls that take the shape of an animal, but similar with people around you to become friends and enemies. She is thrown into a perilous adventure when she overhears a conversation of an extraordinary microscopic particle, Dust. This particle is said to unite different worlds, and is feared by many who want to destroy it forever. As Lyra is flung into the middle of this horrible struggle, she meets wondrous creatures both big and small, and villains who are not what they seem. Gobblers, that kidnap children, will turn out in the most unexpected places. And a magical compass of gold that will answer any question if one is skilled enough to read it. Lyra's adventure continues throughout these three books, and the first is about to be told. The only problem that I had with this movie was the Anti-Christian overtones of the Magisterium during the film. I'm not with the Catholic Church, but I agree that the word \""""""""Heresy\"""""""" was the only reason why the second and third movies would not be adapted into screen. That's it for my problem. The casting was great and the actors were very decent. Daniel Craig was solid as Lord Asriel despite the fact that he wasn't given enough screentime. Nicole Kidman was decent as Mrs. Coulter, but her hair is very different from the book counterpart as it describes her hair as blond. Ian Mckellen was amazing as the great armoured ice bear (also known as a Pansjorborne) Iorek Byrnison, and Dakota Blue Richards was very convincing and compelling as Lyra when it comes to actresses in movie adaptations and the rest of the actors turned out good. The sets were very creative, but at most times, they were quite dark due to the Svalbard place. The CGI on the animals are very damn impressive. The daemons (just like in the book despite the fact that it was mispronounced) were very visualized and the polar bears are also visualized. The action scenes were very epic and the direction from Chris Wietz was well-paced. The Golden Compass lacks in any depth, but it is a darker, deeper, and fantastic adaptation of Phillip Pullman's greatest fantasy series. 8/10"""""""" ]"""""",0,1,0,1"

However, I laughed the most at this one. It started out semi slow and I thought I'd actually hate one of Wes Anderson's flicks but which all the crazy heists in the beginning and the end and the surprise (to me) romance element, I was hooked till the end and was left very satisfied.

The story is predictable but what makes it enjoyable are the characters, the acting, and the relationships (particularly Will’s relationship with Williams’ character as well as his relationship with Ben Affleck’s character). It’s a nice feel good movie. My only issues come from the last third/fourth of the movie where we have to sit through a lot of arguing as well as moping and doping even though its obvious that the film will end on a happy note and what that note will be specifically. Since this is a Robin Williams movie where he plays a teacher that inspires a pupil, I feel its fair to compare it to Dead Poet’s Society, which is a better film. I found the arc of the students’ in that film to be far more interesting and I like how the happy ending comes at the cost of some tragedy. Additionally, that film was not as predictable. With all that said though I still enjoy Good Will Hunting it’s a heart-warming film with a good message that pulls at your heart strings. It makes you laugh and cry as well as remember a time when cell phones did not exist and the Dunkin Donuts logo looked different. It is cliché and predictable but I’m willing to overlook it because the characters are likeable and the relationships are fantastic especially in the first half (second half/third is where the clichés fall in).

The reason why I like this film so much is the fact that Bryan will stop at nothing to get his daughter back, not caring what risks he takes, he will do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to get back his daughter. He shoots his old friens wife in the arm, he chases a boat by driving at high speed the wrong way down a road and leaves a man to die from electrocution. At one point, he gets stabbed, shot and jumps through a glass pane, but none of that even slows him down, because his daughter's the most important thing to him, and he will endure anything to save her life. Liam Neeson is utterly believable in this role. Proof is in the scene where he listens to his daughter being kidnapped and says a little speech to the kidnapper, that if she is let go, he'll forget the whole thing, but if not, he will hunt the kidnapper down and kill him. Every single word Neeson says here, you believe him. You believe that he will stay true to his word and kill the man responsible for this, and he eventually does. This film boasts some brilliant action sequences, especially when Neeson finds the man he spoke to on the phone. He kills every man in that room and that dare to wander in his path, leaving the kidnapper to his self. I think I especially like this film because it reminds me of a favourite show of mine, the recently cancelled 24. Think about it, Neeson channels Jack Bauer, doing anything to get his daughter back, not giving a damn about the consequences, not thinking twice, doing whatever it takes to get back his kidnapped daughter within a time frame. Also, the action sequences, where Neeson is faced against a large number of men, but ends up winning nonetheless. This movie does exactly what it says on the tin, being a high octane action film with Neeson wanting to get his daughter back, and it doesnt try to pretend to be anything more.

With all the adult content I sometimes wonder whether I can handle an R rated movie. Up until today the only really good R rated movie I saw was Super Bad. However, the Hangover knocks that movie out of the ballpark. The plot of the film is essential these four guys have decided to have a bachelor party in Vegas. So they go out and have a good time. Come next morning though the bachelor is nowhere to be found and three guys can't remember anything from the night before. So begins their hilarious quest to find Doug, the bachelor. Most of the humor in this movie revolves around these guys finding out what it was they did the other night. Without giving anything away all I'm going to say is that these guys did some serious s-word. The core of this comedy is these guys finding out what they did through the consequences of their actions. Throughout a good portion of that part of the film I was laughing my head off. However, the jokes began to dry out after the trunk incident. Nonetheless when this water is boiling it makes the kettle whistle. For any parents reading this let me assure that the Hangover isn't the most adult movie in the world. Most of the R rated content comes in the form of the language used. In fact there was nothing really that disturbing in this movie. Nonetheless, this movie is still for the more mature audience. The Hangover is the comedy. It will make you laugh so hard that you'll either throw your head back clap your hands, or both. However, the humor fails to endure for the entire film . Nonetheless, the movie is hilarious long enough for me to give it an 85/100. However, since Metacritic doesn't do decimals I'm stuck giving my secondary opinion.

Road Trip, Old Scool, Starsky & Hutch, and the upcoming Due Date starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. I didn't care for most of the previous titles, except Old School. It took me a long time to see Old School, but when I did I was thoroughly satisfied. It wasn's the movie itself that I fell in love with, as much as the genuine feeling of comradery and friendship between Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank the Tank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn). That is the very same feeling I get when I watch The Hangover. The actors all have a chemistry that makes you believe what's happening to them, no matter how outrageous it is. Zach Galifiankis was the best. What a great way to break onto the movie scene, after a decade of extra roles, and tv spots. The slogan, \""""""""Some guys just can't handle Vegas\"""""""" is perfect. Without saying, if you saw the trailer you alreay know that the premise of the story is a bit extreme, but I never got the feeling that events from the film were beyond the realm of reality. Another great thing about this movie was the cameos. I'm always a sucker for good cameos, and The Hangover doesn't disappoint. I loved the appearances of Ken Jeong as the gay Chinese gangster Mr. Chow, Rob Riggle as the over-caffinated cop, and Mike Epps as black Doug. Oh yeah, and that other Mike too. Although, they probally shouldn't have spoiled that one in the preview. With so much going on in the story, this film could have easily had a few unfilled plot holes, but I'm happy to say that it didn't. The only question that went unanswered was how that chicken got in the hotel room. The Hangover was one of my favorite films of the summer. That's saying alot because there were quite a few great movies that came out in the summer of 2009. Todd Phillips may use the same basic buddy comedy palette for each of his movies, but why shouldn't he? It works. I can't wait for Due Date. And if theres any truth to this, we should be expecting a sequal to The Hangover. My fingers are crossed for that one."""""""" ]"""""",0,1,0,1"

Visually the movie looks great and the world of Pandora is gorgeous. Unfortunately, since I wasn't watching it in 3d I wasn't as sucked into the world of Avatar as I would've otherwise. As far as plot goes the movie does a nice job. The characters and setting are great and the one guy having two identities keeps things interesting as he struggles to find out who he really is. Also, the story in Avatar Humans vs. Navi is different but at the same time very familiar, which I like. My one criticism is where the movie ends. (SPOILIERS ALERT) I really don't like how the Navi defeat the humans because it feels almost forced in there. A more appropriate ending would be when the Navi set off to fight the humans. As a result, of adding on the climactic battle, the movie was too long for my tastes and started to drag. Avatar is the one movie that everyone should see particulary in 3d. You will be amased at the amount of detail in Pandora and find the plot to be very interesting.

The film ticks along as a comical history lesson, with Seth Rogen being the real comic force in the film as Paul the alien, while the men chasing down this other life form also hit some hysterical high notes with the serious and typical formation of what we would expect of a 'government agent' in Jason Bateman, but his two bumbling sidekicks played by Bill Hader and Jo Lo Truglio who are treating their job like first timers, and their comedy is juvenile but brilliant. This all leads into an explosive finale which combines everything we've seen and adds in a few surprises to keep it fresh and interesting."""""""", """"""""The film works with the same plot devices as many same genre films, but it benefits from the powerhouse comic cast and funny supporting cast. It re-enacts and parodies many devices used over the years, the agents, the unknown voice and boss who is identified only through hands and of course the touching moments where Paul re-visits those whose lives he changed many years before. The nice alternate take on a lengthy tale of alien encounters is a welcome relief and adds plenty of amusing anecdotes to pop culture tales from Paul's point of view, it takes some predictable turns but then flips them around to keep surprising and enlightening the audience throughout."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

I myself haven't seen the original Tron film, so I can't say whether its a worthy sequel or whether it was worth the wait, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The special effects were quite awesome and the film brilliantly made use of the IMAX 3D, and managed to give us some astounding graphics within the Grid. It's good that the film makes concessions to those that haven't seen Tron, by giving us a little backstory about the first film and how it ties into the second film. The lightcycles and light disk fights are the best parts of the movie, and there should've been more of that. The acting is quite good, all of the actors give great performances, especially Garret Hedlund as main character, Sam. Martin Sheen gives the best performance, as the vibrant and ecstatic bar owner Zeus, injecting charisma into every scene he's in. And Daft Punk get three cameos as DJs, changing the song when a fight breaks out. However, this isn't a perfect film. A number of the dialogue that comes from Sams mouth sounds quite cliched and the script isn't exactly oscar-worthy. It isn't exactly a surprise when Zeus betrays Sam to CLU and it seems pointless having Quorra send him there in the first place. And the final part in the grid where Flynn has CLU bond back with him makes you think \""""""""why wait until now to do that?\"""""""". Also, de-aging Jeff Bridges doesn't exactly work, just making him seem video-gamey. Granted, it works for CLU, but doesn't really work for Flynn. All in all, I recommend this film.

The interesting thing here is that this girl is discovering the world, learning how to survive. But she is frightened of the unknown things, which are for example living independently, detachment from the family, own survival, civilized humans, melting icecaps and storms"",""all these things are represented as strange and fantastic creatures that chase the protagonist. The problem is that Hushpuppy insists on trying to hold on the things she had sometime, that is why she is a mess without her father or likes to talk to a shirt pretending to be her absent mother. Another exciting topic is that the only thing that the protagonist knows for sure is that everything fits perfectly in the universe and has a natural course, so one change should lead to another. This turns out to be a very surprising movie and Quvenzhane Wallis did a dazzling performance, very uncommon for a girl of that age."""""""" ]"""""",2,2,2,0"

Anthony Hopkins portrays the esteemed man behind such films as \""""""""North by Northwest\"""""""" and \""""""""Psycho\"""""""", the latter being the film for which this biopic is set around. But the film isn't so much a life story, but more a love story and relationship study between \""""""""Hitch\"""""""" and his doting wife, Alma (Helen Mirren), a woman who has all the skills to last on her own, but follows her husband wherever he may go, she writes and helps him on his way to stardom, but he felt he had to change, he wasn't getting any younger and Hitch himself wanted to show his ability to be diverse. Hopkins plays a man who seems to be aware of everything around him, he knew what needed to be done to give a film that unique edge, Hopkins excellently shows an outcast in  someone with an unorthodox technique, but one which works. But the film focuses too much on the marriage of Hitch and Alma, while intriguing and well fitted, not enough time is given to the making of Psycho, this would have certainly been more logical considering the controversial nature of the film and the amount of coverage it received upon its release. This aside, the sublime performances of Hopkins and Mirren are enough to see this film, Hopkins commands the screen and works fluently with a darkly humoured script, while Mirren is an independent yet loving wife to a legend, but also struggles with her own identity and finds solace in the innocent company of Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston) while Hitch continues to show admiration for leading ladies Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Vera Miles (Jessica Biel), not major roles the film, nor do they look much like the originals, but great performances soon fix that. The ensemble of fine performances are definitely worth applauding, with a strong script and unique direction to accompany this riveting film, it could have chose a better path, but still fires strong on all cylinders to outline  an iconic man, or more so, an iconic couple who changed the landscape of what it means to scare people, looking for that perfect factor, she wrote it, he showed it."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

It looks the part, sounds the part, but doesn't completely feel the part. I feel that they tried really hard and stayed as close to the source material as they could, but I also feel like they watered it down too much so that it could get a lower age rating and appeal to a broader audience.

Max Steel is an admirable attempt at getting another series going, but was ultimately doomed to be DOA due to the fact that it's a more obscure character and clearly just didn't have the flash or history of it's competition. That's not to say it's all bad though. In fact, Max Steel can be quite entertaining. It's just that a reliance on formula holds it back. It's pretty much your standard superhero origin story. You can see bits of Raimi's Spider-Man as Max McGrath plays around with his newly discovered powers, the plot itself is derivative of those two Amazing Spider-Man movies, and the villain feels like he was pulled straight from 2008's Iron Man. It's a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas tied together with the character's own original lore, which I must say is surprisingly well-handled in that you get an answer to all your questions by the end of the film. Further explanation as to the reasoning behind those explanations, like what actually causes Max's weird powers in the first place isn't something the movie gets into. Oh, so he's filled with Tachyon energy. Why? Because aliens? Okay I guess.

Bone is not bad, the only thing I am against is that Disney continues to use the cliche to Kill the parents of the protagonist and the character you loved you so much, it's something that we have seen in many Disney movies and I still do not understand why still do, maybe is its a formula of making movies or maybe is a betrayal of the studio, do not know. If they wanted to kill as Tadashi do it but at least let their parents are alive, not make them disappear from the film and say they are dead without explaining how they died. I also found it absurd that the reason for why is Callaghan the bad guy and the Baymax sacrifice, i know many people cry but I'm sorry, I'm think it's really silly and absurd, but the film is really bad? no, it could have been better? probably yes. There are many things that they liked me the film, I like animation, the characters, the comedy, the action scenes, the city San Fransokyo, the tecnology, the friendly relationship of Hiro and Baymax and the message. I just do like Minions as if it werent these 2 problems the film could have been better. In my opinion, Big Hero 6 is entertaining, Not the best of the year but is entertaining.

Seeing as how this movie was co-written by McCarthy and her husband, who also directed, this is a movie that was built from the ground up to play off of that character type and I was sure it was going to be hilarious. While it is funny it is also unfortunately bogged down by some lackluster and overly-familiar dramatic elements. It's very been there done that, and often that will apply to some of the movies jokes as well. There are some times when the jokes just fall flat, but thankfully the overall movie does pack plenty of laugh-worthy moments even if it does play things safe at times by not straying too far from what is expected of R-rated comedies nowadays. It's a good comedy, and while it's emotional moments fail to deliver, Melissa McCarthy is still funny enough to make it worth a watch.

"the-amazing-spider-man,7,Jacob,/user/Jacob,""May 12, 2014"",""""""[ """"""""The Amazing Spider-Man is a mixed bag getting a lot of stuff right and some stuff eh. The film smartly chooses to really develop Peter Parker making him a full fleshed out character, which is why I love Spider-Man. The film also smartly goes for a more realistic story as opposed to the cartoony/light-hearted feel of the Raimi films giving the movie an identity of its own. The film suffers though from a not so impressive supporting cast, a second half that lacks the depth/substance that made the first half mostly engaging, and rehashing some stuff from the original film. At the end of the day though I liked it. In all honest there are two big reasons why this film didn’t leave that big of an impact on me. For starters, I have immense love of the original films (especially the first two), which will be hard to shake and the fact that this film is coming out ten years after the original Spider-Man movie and five years after the last Spider-Man film so that one is still stuck in my mind. Maybe if the film had come out later or been the original Spider-Man movie I would be more in love with it as opposed to comparing it to the original because it works as its own thing. The second reason why I feel like this movie didn’t make that big of an impression on me was because it came out the same year as The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises two big superhero movies that had a lot of people talking and I guess this one just got lost in the shuffle. So if you are one of the people who missed this film when it came out check this film out as it is entertaining. I’d especially recommend it to people who didn’t think much of the original film as people who didn’t care much for it (ex. Doug Walker, Confused Matthew, and Roger Ebert) seem to prefer this one. If I could shake my nostalgia for the original I’d probably really enjoy it to. If you are a die hard fan of the original like me then try to go in with an open mind or you will be disappointed like I was upon my first viewing. The second time around I was able to accept the film for what it was and appreciate it for what it was trying to do. This is a good start to this new Spider-Man franchise and I hope that Sony keeps it going and doesn’t botch up the second one along with the other planned sequels or they’ll have to try again in another 10 years (which they will probably do anyway) and I don’t know how it will be reviewing the reboot of the reboot."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

He also ups the gore and violence while simultaneously giving us more insight as to how exactly the whole Hostel situation works.

The blood is gratuitous, the deaths are twisted, and the grimier visual style and environments is very reminiscent of the Saw series. Essentially Part II really embraces the \""""""""torture porn\"""""""" angle.

It makes them more likable, even if the main is that perfect pretty girl who everything works out for no matter what the situation apparently. Leaner and meaner, Hostel proves worth revisiting in Part II. Roth trimmed the fat from the first movie and loves letting this sequel flex it's new muscles with some more violent scenes and a little more insight as to how the whole setup works. It's still a little bare bones in the actual plot department and some scenes are still a little slow, but at the end of the day this is still one of those rare movie sequels that's an actual improvement on the original.

Whether or not that's a good thing just comes to down to your tastes. The actual torture is brief and muted.

But these genuine moments are comprised of smaller moments that happen in the broader scheme, there are a lot of things going on to the point where many characters get left behind, but I’ll get to that. We meet Jeremy and John, played by the excellent comedy duo of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, a pair of wedding crashers, there is no catch here, this is what they actually do, besides being lawyers, they crash an obscene amount of weddings as a way to bed various lucky ladies who are present at the wedding, then they move on, some of these scenes are terrific as they fake their way into the ceremony and then deliver the goods in the reception. The real punch comes in the form of Treasury Secretary Clearly, who is played by none other than Christopher Walken, this guy can make anything sound funny, yet he is grossly underused in this comedy, is that even possible? But even so, Jeremy and John are after the daughters of the man, seeing this as the jackpot, they get in quite deep, Jeremy (Vaughn) seduces the crazy and unstable Gloria (Isla Fisher) while John falls for the irresistible Claire (Rachel McAdams). But Claire has a fiancee, the not very nice Sack (Bradley Cooper), who is just quite uncomfortable to watch in each scene he is in, Cooper is a phenomenal actor, but his role in this film is jarring and distracting. The bum note of the film is the opportunities it misses, dragging out scenes for longer than they should and not giving enough for Walken to do, but the film has excellent moments with Vaughn and Wilson on top form, they often stray off in perfect comic timing which unfortunately loses steam as the film ticks on, there is a lot of talent that is underused, such as Henry Gibson playing a priest who doesn’t really have much to do apart from making various faces to show shock or other emotions at stories he is told, or the forgotten son, Todd (Keir O’Donnell), who has many funny moments and setups, but ultimately these don’t amount to much. One of the highlights actually comes from a small role for Will Ferrell, playing the master of the wedding crashing game, his moments on screen are comedy gold but just don’t last long enough. In the midst, this is still a funny film, it has plenty of gags that work in relation to the film and has its fair share of top notch scenes, particularly more candid ones amongst the talent rather than she they are all in the same room at the same time."""""""", """"""""The idea and some of the delivery is there, this has an all star cast but simply loses track too many times which leaves its consistency in the gutter, but some decent performances and also some side splitting moments make this enjoyable enough, but a bit too long for its misplacement."""""""" ]"""""",0,1,0,1"

Steve Martin commands the screen and calmly narrates this mash-up of coming of age, comedy, letting go and matrimony. Martin plays George Banks, a typical 'dad' who protects and looks after his own, so you could imagine that when his daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) announces she is getting married to a virtual stranger in the form of Bryan (George Newbern) George is less than impressed, his slip of the tongue and erratic behaviour says it all, but there is never any danger that the film will throw some twisted turn of fate, a film so full of joy it can actually hurt to smile that much, while all the usual wedding obstacles occur, but these are really only there for the comedy value, not for reflective means, but the comedy is certainly there, in the form of Martin Short sporting a very peculiar accent, his flamboyant and barely understandable voice make up a fair amount of gags and generally funny personality traits. My lingering problem is the amount of fluttering butterflies that the film creates, it paints a picture that any wedding you wish to have is possible, which is untrue, but I don't believe the film was about creating a realistic explanation, but more show the journey the parents make, but again, the journey only seems to consist of daddy, as esteemed actress Diane Keaton, who plays other Nina, plays a largely unimportant role, perhaps a traditional scenario calls for a father and his daughter, but the mother is as equally important. Soundtrack, dialogue and flowing direction make this the joyous occasion indeed, granted it can often fill one with false hope, but strong performances and some heartfelt scenes make this is a very happy affair, perhaps one of the happiest, the chemistry between Martin and Williams-Paisley is convincing and full of meaningful tone, Steve Martin especially controls the situation, it's really his film and that's not a bad thing, his charisma and attitude make the film what it is, it's quite difficult to imagine anyone else in the role, even after all these years.  Not the most convincing of messages throughout the film, but it definitely feels good to sit and watch the film, relaxing, funny, well orchestrated and insightful for all."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

Rachel McAdams plays the overworked girl, but she doesn't oversell her character which seems to be common territory now, it's quite easy to get carried away with plot details, but McAdams has had her fair share of mainstream roles over the years, she reacts how we assume people would react in these situations, but of course this doesn't come without a plot that has no need to be as complex and figuring as it is, but she has a foe in the form of Jackson, playing what appears to be the ideal man behind her in the check-in line, he helps her out with another unruly passenger, buying her a drink and laughing over each others names and stories about relatives, but he has plans when they board their flight, his charm soon turns to sinister motives when he outlines his plan to Lisa, not to give too much away, but her retired father (Brian Cox) is somewhat involved in a sort of hostage situation that depends on Lisa following everything she is told. The film uses its plane setting to its advantage, using the enclosed space for more candid scenes and that added dose of claustrophobic intensity. We have quite a short and snappy thrill ride in Red Eye, strong performances from the increasingly brilliant McAdams and the resident bad guy Murphy prove to make the film what it is, especially when they hit the ground and a car and mouse game ensues, Murphy's character still soldiers on, even with a pen lodged into his neck. Wes Craven is the man behind the 'Scream' series, it's clear here as he often creates situations that are often comical more than they are frightening, but the chemistry between the two leads leaves the small flaws behind, this is interesting, thrilling and well acted in a short time frame, it doesn't sell out but instead casts McAdams who doesn't forget the sort of film she's doing, but also remains believable and doesn't oversell the plot at all, definitely a film that succeeds in not dragging out scenarios but gets to the point."""""""" ]"""""",0,2,0,2"

Bruce has a breakdown and decides to take his anger out on the skies, namely God, who answers Bruce in the most unorthodox of ways, giving him all his powers and telling him to use them how he pleases. While the powers of God throughout the film bring excellent comedy and impressive visual gags like the part of the soup, clearly a direct reference to Moses, and others like pulling the moon closer or even the voice change for his rival Evan, it sometimes feels over-bearing when you realise a film is being made about powers that are truly limitless, so where do you even start with that. The true spark of the film rests on the  shoulders of Carrey and his energetic persona that he brings to most of his roles, it's difficult to imagine anyone else playing the role, and a deliberate pacing and subtle references to larger compromises in the film do make it a predictable in many parts, but strong performances from Carrey as the down on his luck news reporter, while is girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) is forever trying to keep Bruce grounded. Then we have God himself, played by none other than Morgan Freeman, who has many a philosophical tale to tell us and inspire the hoard as we watch, it's entertaining but also hold sentimental value, especially when the elegant and almighty voice of Freeman is saying it. The theme of it all really tries to test the selfishness of selflessness of the human psyche, how much would one person do before trying to help others if they has unlimited capabilities? Sure we might indulge a little but when it comes down to it, what would you do. But this is of course coming from a comedy angle, many will simply treat this has a quirky idea for a film, while others will see it as blasphemy for  treating the entity of God on such a comical way, but then again, laughter is the language of the soul, and while there are laughs to be had, it misses the mark when trying to be too serious and shifting its tone, while also focusing and relying to much on Jim Carrey's personality.

We are introduced to the fast talking publicist that is Stu Shepard, phone to the ear and barking various orders to his lackey, he lies and cheats his way through life, which comes back to bite him, he uses a pay phone to call his mistress Pamela (Katie Holmes) so as his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) is unaware when she checks his phone records, ruling out the possibility of her becoming aware of his adultery. What dear Stu doesn’t anticipate is answering the pay phone to a confidently spoken man who knows just about every single thing about our now edgy publicist, oh yeah and the man on the other line has a sniper pointed at Stu, under the illusion that Stu deserves to die for his life of shame and fakery, he’s essentially playing God and yet he is only a voice, but a commanding voice is also one not to be messed with, something that Stu finds out all to soon after a run in with some irritated street walkers and their pimp, his day just eta worse and worse. As the intention starts to grow on Stu and police start arriving, Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) starts figuring out that perhaps Stu is actually incapable of putting down the phone for fear of getting a bullet through his head, they are under the belief that Stu has a gun, yet aren’t completely sold on the whole story that they’re being fed. Director Joel Schumacher knows how to heighten the tension as he often focuses the camera on what appear to be menial objects at first, but soon play out to be much more vital, he also gives the whole thing a sense of humour, which is a nice touch. Most of the humour and tension comes from the voice on the phone, the anti-hero perhaps. The voice is Kiefer Sutherland, who brings a soft yet effective tone that is refreshing to listen to but menacing when need be. It becomes unclear wether he has any intention of killing Stu, but it makes the film much more enthralling when he never seems to lose his cool and has Stu in all sorts of knots, a snappy and enjoyable film that seems to hold so much more under the hood and has more pressing motives that it doesn’t play."""""""" ]"""""",1,4,1,3"

There is an imaginative concept behind the Monsters world. The characters are likeable. Plus, the animation is great giving us a bright and colorful world. On the other hand, this film does not offer much for an older audience. The story does not have much too it and the characters are simple, both lacking the sosphistication of later Pixar films and Toy Story although I have not seen the original in a while so I cannot say that. So I will wrap up my review with this. If you have little kids and you are looking for something fun and safe to show them, show them this film they will probably love it like I did back when I first saw the film in first grade. However, if you are looking for animated film with some sophistication then you might want to look elsewhere. While Monsters Inc. is a great kids film it is an ok film. Given the weak performance of Cars 2, which is for babies, and Brave, which was consisted mostly of an unoriginal story with only the last third being interesting, I am worried that Monsters University will be another film for the kiddies as opposed to the people who saw the original as kids and are now adults and/or in college."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

The movie's running time is around two hours. That may seems like a lot for a horror film, especially given the era, but it was practically a necessity in order to allow the story to breath. Ironically one of the movie's biggest flaws is that it drags it's feet a bit. However, the fact that it takes the time to do that is most likely what saved it as well. The Dark Half stands as a solid entry in both King and Romero's film catalog.

I enjoyed seeing my favorite moments from it being brought to life before my very eyes. There are a few minor differences in dialog here and there, and the character Victor Pascow is given a larger role, but the only big change comes from the removal of Jud Crandall's wife. Her role in the story has been given instead to the maid, Missy Dandridge. With the screenplay having been written by Stephen King himself, you can tell this decision was made just so there would be a difference between the book and movie that's a little more distinguishable than the rest. Something more significant to possibly encourage people to check out both versions of the fiction. It ultimately effects very little. The fidelity to the source material guarantees that this movie is sure to be a hit with fans of the novel. The level of success it will find among those who have not read the Stephen King story is more up to question."""""""", """"""""When I watched the movie I tried to do so from two perspectives"",""one as a fan of the book, and one as an outsider who never picked up a copy. While the fan in me was mostly pleased, the part of me that had to view it with out any knowledge of what happened in the book was a little more critical of the flaws. It's not hard to notice how flatly acted the whole thing is. Not hard at all. Our lead Dale Midkiff is the worst offender. He's far too wooden and lifeless. Former sitcom star Fred Gwynne feels a bit too suited for comedy to play a truly great Jud Crandall. In the final act though he really shapes up and shows some true emotion. There are also some poor decisions made with some scenes that rob them of their potential creepiness. For example a few scenes include interactions between a grown man and an obviously lifeless mannequin/doll. These issues could have been in part the fault of either time or budget constraints. Maybe both. Then there's the fact that the movie sort of rushes through the plot of the book. It jumps from major event to major event at occasionally jarring speeds. Never sticking around long enough to really sell the horror or capture the emotions that were on display in the novel. All of these were things that could have handled better if the movie had been in the hands of a better director. I get that there was a lot of material to cover, but some of these mistakes feel amateurish in nature."""""""", """"""""Still, the movie has it's creepy moments in it's final act and some of the more potent themes from the book manage to still find their way in here as well.

And as I've said before, those who have read the book this movie is based on are practically guaranteed to find at least a small level of enjoyment here for the faithfulness alone. Even if they too find it to be unintentionally funny at times or not quite so well-executed in some areas. As it stands, this is definitely among the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel in the exactness department.

It really makes you realize how much traditional horror movies rely on things like music to build up tension, and how effective those techniques actually are. In the case of The Blair Witch Project all you get are the strange sounds coming from the very dark woods. It's an original way of presenting things. The movie relies a lot on the imagination of the viewer to freak themselves out. Now, I complain about jump scares a lot in horror movies these days, but part of me wonders if this movie could have used some.

The characters spend too much time doing stupid things like arguing when they should be moving. When they are constantly getting in their own way you almost don't want to feel sorry for them. Yet, you do. They're tired, frustrated, and of course scared. It's only natural for a person to loose their cool and make bad decisions in that sort of scenario.

If I were to criticize the film though there were a few isseus I had. Red wasn’t in the movie a lot but that’s more the poster leading me to believe he would play a bigger role in the film than he actually did. Also, some scenes in the movie dragged and were not that funny and at other times the humor got a little too stupid for my tastes. The film also does the annoying cliché where two friends get into an argument for no reason and then break up, which is annoying not only because of how out of nowhere the argument is but because you know what is going to happen they will mope and dope and then they’ll get back together. Finally, the film was a little too similar to Evan Goldberg’s Superbad in that it features two guys who get into a jam involving them on a crazy adventure and on the run form the police, there is a side plot involving one or more hilarious police characters, police cars get destroyed, the climax features one character carrying another away from a building and there is emphasis on something that is considered wrong with Superbad’s being underage sex and Pineapple Express’ being marijuana."""""""" ]"""""",0,0,0,0"

On top of that, the villain's motivation is much more clear that the previous one's. As far as action goes the movie does not disappoint. All the action was awesome. However, I couldn't really get into. This was due either to the fact that I'm more mature or the fact that people were talking during the movie. Either way I was still able to enjoy the action but wasn't fully engrossed in it. One final thing I'd like to bring up is as always Robert Downey Jr. gives a spectacular performance creating a like able protagonist thats interesting. All and all Iron Man 2 is a good movie. The characters are interesting and the action is good. What prevents it from getting the solid 10/10 is the fact that it didn't suck me in as well as the first.

With the third book being my least favorite this could be to Hunger Games what Spider-Man 3, X-Men 3: The Last Stand, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End where to their franchise the threequel that ruined everything.

Second is his nephew Patrick, going through adolescence, very closed to himself, shielding in girlfriends, friends, a band, the town, in order to escape from the true.

Those three performances are amazing, Casey Affleck is carries out the movie, Lucas Hedge surprised me a lot and Michelle Williams is heartbreaking.

As far as faithfulness to the source material goes, this is likely the most successful video game movie yet. A surprising fact given that it tells it's own original story. Normally that's kind of a red flag. While every video game movie diverts from it's influence(s) in some way or another, some go way too far and push away even the hardcore fans of the series. Even the ones that aren't complete bastardizations are disappointing to fans in some way. They may stick just closely enough or have the right amount of nods to keep these fans at least entertained, but the diversions are still enough to keep them stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground in their minds when all is said and done."""""""", """"""""The reason why that isn't the case here is that the events of the movie are still closely bound to the lore of the games. A fact we can most likely accredit to the supposed nature of being set in the same universe as the games. The only thing it does really different is an insignificant change to the animus that's really nothing more than a different model. This is very much the same Assassin's Creed as the games. It's just a new chapter in the story. So as a result this a no-brainer for fans."""""""", """"""""Exactly like the games there are two sides (or rather time periods) to the story. The modern day side of things is actually a return to form for the series. The video games lost their way in this area when they wrote themselves into a hole with AC3. This movie sets things right with a compelling narrative and characters that harken back to that first game where the Templars were using ancestors of the Assassins to hunt down powerful artifacts. Everything that first made that side of things interesting is in place here. It may give too little explanation as to the more sci-fi elements going on to appeal to the more casual audience, but those familiar with the source material should have no problem knowing what's going on."""""""", """"""""Then there's the part of the story that takes place in the past. Where the conflict between Assassins and Templars is at it's most action packed. Usually it's also where it's at it's most interesting as well. That isn't so much the case here. That's because it's Assassin protagonists aren't really characters and more just vehicles to deliver the action. We know nothing about them and there isn't really much of a story happening in this time period. We do get some stellar visuals though and the Assassins act like Assassins. They rely on some nice tactics and tools from the games to make things more believable. While there are plenty of fight scenes and exciting, acrobatic chases, they do rely on some stealth moments before all of this happens so that they feel like true assassins."""""""", """"""""Now most of what I've said here probably sounds like a dream come true for Assassin's Creed fans. That's because in a lot of ways this movie is. It is not however a perfect movie. The action is a key example of this. While often exciting, it does suffer from overactive camera work. Shots jump around so much during the fighting that it's hard to actually see what's going on. For every cool moment there's about three or so where things are just a visual mess. The tendency to jump back in forth through time to see future/present Fassbender doing the same things as his ancestor in the past is also an annoyance. I get the idea. It's a way to show off how the new Animus works, but they could have done this once or twice the first time it's being used instead of continuing this trick throughout the entire movie. It's much more interesting to watch the Assassin ancestor fight real people than it is to watch Fassbender swat at shadows in the present day."""""""", """"""""The rest of the issues the movie has are only really going to affect people unfamiliar with the games. An flaw that is both fortunate and unfortunate in it's own ways. Non-fans are likely going to be confused by the sci-fi side of things which forgoes explanations here and there, as well as the lack of story for the Assassin's conflicts in the past. These also have the potential to annoy fans as well, but they are more likely to be forgiving towards them given how faithful this adaption is to the games."""""""", """"""""For Assassin's Creed fans this is a must see. Never before has a video game series been so lovingly captured and portrayed in movie form. Nearly every element of the series from it's conception back in 2007 with the first game is in place for the movie. The original tale captures even the series forgotten or mistreated ones. Those who don't play the games or just never liked are likely to find less enjoyment here.

However given how many steps forward the superhero movie genre has taken over the years, and Brian Singer's reliance on standard tropes, Apocalypse ends up being an odd mixture of better late than never, and too little, too late."""""""", """"""""There's a lot to like about Apocalypse. We get the return of the great cast from First Class and DoFP like Fassbender and McAvoy, Sophie Turner's Jean Grey, Evan Peters continually enjoyable Quicksilver complete with more of those amazing super-speed action sequences, and it doesn't crap all over Cyclops. It's got some of the best portrayals of these X-Men characters we've seen onscreen so far. The interpretations still aren't perfect mind you. DoFP couldn't fix everything, so things like age and timeline discrepancies keep things from being just as every comic book fan wants to see it. Nothing short of a reboot of the series will fix that. However, this is still the best we've gotten so far in that department."""""""", """"""""Given that Apocalypse seemingly does so much right by making good on the promise DoFP set the series up for, what keeps it from achieving greatness? That answer is simply that it's too familiar. With the MCU dominating theatres, the DCEU getting up and running, and the X-Men's own lengthy presence on the silver screen we've seen a lot of villains want to destroy the world. And quite frankly, they were more interesting than Apocalypse."""""""", """"""""The movie just has a very bland villain.

The likes of which we've seen in a lot of superhero films lately. Not even the constant display and barrage of these character's powers carries the same level of excitement as before.

Brain Singer and FOX do their best to give us the X-Men movie we should've received in the first place all those years ago. For the most part they succeed. The issue it's a little late to do that. The superhero genre has taken off and reached heights one could hardly believe. Going back to basics wounds them here. They got off to their post-DoFP timeline with a shaky start."""""""", """"""""Does any of this mean Apocalypse is an outright bad movie? No, it's just behind the times. A flaw that's easier to forgive when you consider this is a close as we've come to that perfect X-Men lineup. There's a sort of classic X-Men feel to it and it's just nice to see a lot of the original characters like Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Storm get some real screen-time and actually take part in the action without Hugh Jackman's Wolverine hogging the spotlight. So yeah, it's the most admirable attempt at giving us the perfect X-Men movie that's sadly flawed in key areas. For some this simply isn't going to be enough. For others like myself this will still be a respectable and enjoyable movie. One that still manages to entertain for (finally!) exploring other, original X-Men.

Only this time in live-action form. If one was hoping for a more faithful adaptation of the original story this time around, then they would be disappointed. This pretty much just a remake of the 1991 animated classic. It never strays from what that movie did by much at all, outside of it's own little personal touches to make it not quite a 100% repeat. As a result we are left with a movie that is very familiar as was to be expected based on those trailers. It's very \""""""""been there, done that\"""""""" and doesn't hold a candle to it's animated counterpart. Yet by no means is it a bad movie. There's a reason this tale is as old as time and that's because it's a darn good one."""""""", """"""""What keeps it from living up to it's predecessor is that it's more cartoonish in nature. There's an extra added sense of goofiness and more humor to every scene. It's missing that dark, more mature tone that made the original so charming, intimate, and effective. It's wonderful to see the dazzling light and pretty sights the director has in store for you. I also laughed regularly. It's clear that this version is more concerned about pure entertainment than having the tale pull at your heartstrings the way it did back in 1991. They even turned down the more menacing aspects of the Beast's personality like his violent outbursts to make it more appealing to all ages. There was a frightening aspect to the character for me as a kid so I see why they did it, but there's no hiding the fact that it hurts the story and romance in the end. Even in my early years when Beast's angry, loud eruptions gave me a fright I didn't mind them. Even then I noticed how it made Belle's slow peeling back of his layers all the more meaningful and effective. I also wasn't too happy with how characters like Cogsworth were pushed more into the background this time around."""""""", """"""""There's a lot the movie does get right though. For starters it's absolutely gorgeous and the little touches like how the prince's beastly appearance shares features with his true human form. It also extremely well cast. Emma Watson really is the perfect Belle. For the most part the cast has been given more over-the-top versions of the characters. Watson is the only one who plays their character with the exact same conviction as their animated counterpart. Something I do not believe is the rest of the cast's fault. Instead the blame falls on the writer(s) and director. Luke Evans nails Gaston's arrogance and manipulative qualities. Then there's Josh Gad who is an absolute scene-stealer with this new version Le Fou, Gaston's sidekick who turns out to be quite endearing this time around. Much like the animated movie there are musical numbers. Most of which are ripped right from the original. They are surprisingly excellent. The dance accompanying them could have used so much, but it was nice to see, or rather, hear Disney not butcher these wonderful songs."""""""", """"""""It's magic, romance, fantasy, visual splendor, and well-meaning silliness all rolled up into one big movie. We've basically seen this before and it was no doubt better then, but there is still reason to give this not so new version of a tale as old as time a watch. The qualities that made the fairy tale so well-loved in the first part are still here, albeit in lesser form.
